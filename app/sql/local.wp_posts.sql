The Document Object Model allows us to use Javascript to create dynamic pages by controlling elements of the HTML.\r\n\r\nThe DOM works like a tree. The root of the tree is the “Document”, and it’s child is the HTML element. From here, we typically see the tree branch into the head and body elements, and both of those elements have direct children as well. Each element in the DOM is called a “Node”. For example, if you have a tag like this:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<span class=\"code__block\">   &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to my Site!&lt;/h2&gt;</span>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThat is a DOM Node! Keep in mind that each element is its own Node.\r\n\r\nAnother example:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<span class=\"code__block\">   &lt;div class=\"header\"&gt;\r\n\r\n      &lt;div class=\"logo\"&gt;\r\n         &lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;&lt;img ...&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n   &lt;/div&gt;</span>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nIn this example, the “header” div is its own element, and therefore, it is a Node. Then the “logo” is a child Node of the header Node. The “link” element is then a child Node of the logo Node. Each element is a Node. This kind of node structure allows Javascript to move fluidly through the HTML, and work dynamically with these nodes in order to change, add, remove, or otherwise alter each of these elements, giving developers the ability to integrate user interaction and dynamically generated pages.\r\n\r\nWith our JavaScript, we can target these nodes through code that looks like this: <span class=\"inline__code\">var headerNode = document.getElementsByClassName(“header”);</span>. JavaScript has a lot of built-in functionality regarding the DOM, like changing or adding classes, altering link destinations, changing the CSS styling of a single node, or even altering the inner HTML of a tag.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">   Our HTML:\r\n   &lt;h2 id=\"welcome\"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\n   Our JavaScript:\r\n   var welcomeNode = document.getElementById(\"welcome\");\r\n   welcomeNode.innerHTML = \"Welcome!\";\r\n\r\n   Our New HTML:\r\n   &lt;h2 id=\"welcome\"&gt;Welcome!&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n</span></pre>\r\n\r\nNotice how we were able to target the inner HTML of our h2 welcome tag with JavaScript, then change what is contained within this tag? The DOM is incredibly powerful, allowing us to make nodes disappear and reappear, insert the user’s name into our HTML, and make all kinds of changes tailored to the user and their interaction with our site.

The root of the tree is the “Document”, and it’s child is the HTML element. From here, we typically see the tree branch into the head and body elements, and both of those elements have direct children as well. Each element in the DOM is called a “Node”. For example, if you have a tag like this:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n      <span class=\"code__block\">&lt;h1&gt;Welcome to my Site!&lt;/h2&gt;</span>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThat is a DOM Node!

HTML provides us with the building blocks we need to get started putting our site together. Surprisingly, we don\'t need as much as you may think. Here is all of the HTML we\'ll be working with:\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\r\n&lt;html lang=\"en-us\"&gt;\r\n\r\n   &lt;head&gt;\r\n      &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;\r\n      &lt;title&gt;-Where\'s Waldo? Picture #1-&lt;/title&gt;\r\n      &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"&gt;\r\n      &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"scripts.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n   &lt;/head&gt;\r\n\r\n   &lt;body&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=\"wrapper\"&gt;\r\n         &lt;h1&gt;Level 1 - Very Easy&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n         &lt;br&gt;\r\n         &lt;div class=\"gameWindow\"&gt;\r\n            &lt;img src=\"images/Waldo01-easy.jpg\" class=\"searchImage\" id=\"WaldoLevel1\"&gt;\r\n            &lt;h2 id=\"timeLapsed\"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n         &lt;/div&gt;\r\n         &lt;p&gt;Find Waldo!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n         &lt;div id=\"modal\" style=\"display: none\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n         &lt;div id=\"modalContent\" style=\"display: none\"&gt;\r\n            &lt;div id=\"modalTimer\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n            &lt;div id=\"modalMessage\"&gt;Good job!&lt;/div&gt;\r\n            &lt;form action=\"#\" id=\"modalHighScoreButton\"&gt;\r\n               &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"High Scores\"&gt;\r\n            &lt;/form&gt;\r\n            &lt;form action=\"pic2.html\" id=\"modalNext\"&gt;\r\n               &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Next Puzzle\"&gt;\r\n            &lt;/form&gt;			  \r\n         &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n         &lt;div id=\"modalHighScore\" style=\"display: none\"&gt;\r\n            &lt;div id=\"modalHighScoresTitle\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n            &lt;div id=\"actualHighScores\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n            &lt;form action=\"\" id=\"modalHighScoreButton\"&gt;\r\n               &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"High Scores\"&gt;\r\n            &lt;/form&gt;\r\n            &lt;form action=\"pic2.html\" id=\"modalNext\"&gt;\r\n               &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Next Puzzle\"&gt;\r\n            &lt;/form&gt;			  	\r\n         &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n   &lt;/body&gt;\r\n&lt;/html&gt;</span></pre>\r\n\r\n<h3>Note: For now, don\'t worry about the naming convention or folder placement of this file, as we will change it later. Just name the file what you\'d like and place it somewhere inside of your project where you will remember it.</h3>\r\n\r\nIn the head tag, we\'re just telling the program what we would like the title of our page to be, and which files we would like connected to this HTML file, the CSS stylesheet, and our Javascript file.\r\n\r\nWithin the body and wrapper divs, we have the label of what level we\'re on, in this case level 1, and the image we would like the player to search. There are hundreds of Where\'s Waldo images we can use, so pick one that you like!\r\n\r\nFinally, our \"modal\" div will contain the structure we need in order to show the window that will pop up after the user has found Waldo. It will contain the amount of time it took for the user to find Waldo, a short message confirming they found Waldo, and two buttons, \"Next Puzzle\", and \"High Scores\".

It\'s very repetitive. Let\'s break it down:\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">body {\r\n   width: 800px;\r\n   margin-right: auto;\r\n   margin-left: auto;\r\n   background-color: rgb(255, 248, 209);\r\n   background-image: url(\"images/WaldoBG.jpg\");\r\n   background-position: center;\r\n   background-size: cover;\r\n   background-repeat: no-repeat;\r\n   height: 100%;\r\n}\r\n</span></pre>\r\n\r\nIn CSS, each tag targets an HTML element, and styles that element to the specifications in the CSS. So in this example, the width of the HTML element \"body\" has been set to 800 pixels, the background color has been set to a pale yellow, and the body\'s alignment is centered, using the \"margin-left: auto\" and \"margin-right: auto\" lines. We can apply these principles universally by targeting whatevera element we want (h1, p, a, etc.), and styling the aspects of that tag in the way we want. We can even create custom style-types easily by entering div tags in our HTML file with a custom class name, then targeting that class with our CSS in this format: <span class=\"inline__code\">.class-name { styles }</span>. Feel free to play around with these different tags, options, colors, and styles to create your own unique page!\r\n\r\n<h3>Note: For more information on CSS and some of the styling options available, <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/Css/\" target=\"_blank\">check out this tutorial</a>.</h3>","Where\'s Waldo? - Part One","","publish","open","open","","wheres-waldo-part-one","","","2017-10-26 01:09:04","2017-10-26 01:09:04","",0,"http://evingrost.dev/?p=41",0,"post","",0),

HTML provides us with the building blocks we need to get started putting our site together. Surprisingly, we don\'t need as much as you may think.

Just name the file what you\'d like and place it somewhere inside of your project where you will remember it.</h3>\r\n\r\nIn the head tag, we\'re just telling the program what we would like the title of our page to be, and which files we would like connected to this HTML file, the CSS stylesheet, and our Javascript file.\r\n\r\nWithin the body and wrapper divs, we have the label of what level we\'re on, in this case level 1, and the image we would like the player to search. There are hundreds of Where\'s Waldo images we can use, so pick one that you like!\r\n\r\nFinally, our \"modal\" div will contain the structure we need in order to show the window that will pop up after the user has found Waldo. It will contain the amount of time it took for the user to find Waldo, a short message confirming they found Waldo, and two buttons, \"Next Puzzle\", and \"High Scores\". Notice the \"high score\" modal is exactly the same as the modal content block, just with a few different names.\r\n\r\n<h2>Time for Some Cascading Style</h2>\r\n\r\nNow we\'ll take a look at the CSS file, or Cascading Style Sheet.

Just name the file what you\'d like and place it somewhere inside of your project where you will remember it.</h3>\r\n\r\nIn the head tag, we\'re just telling the program what we would like the title of our page to be, and which files we would like connected to this HTML file, the CSS stylesheet, and our Javascript file.\r\n\r\nWithin the body and wrapper divs, we have the label of what level we\'re on, in this case level 1, and the image we would like the player to search.

It\'s very repetitive. Let\'s break it down:\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">body {\r\n   width: 800px;\r\n   margin-right: auto;\r\n   margin-left: auto;\r\n   background-color: rgb(255, 248, 209);\r\n   background-image: url(\"images/WaldoBG.jpg\");\r\n   background-position: center;\r\n   background-size: cover;\r\n   background-repeat: no-repeat;\r\n   height: 100%;\r\n}\r\n</span></pre>\r\n\r\nIn CSS, each tag targets an HTML element, and styles that element to the specifications in the CSS. So in this example, the width of the HTML element \"body\" has been set to 800 pixels, the background color has been set to a pale yellow, and the body\'s alignment is centered, using the \"margin-left: auto\" and \"margin-right: auto\" lines. We can apply these principles universally by targeting whatevera element we want (h1, p, a, etc.), and styling the aspects of that tag in the way we want. We can even create custom style-types easily by entering div tags in our HTML file with a custom class name, then targeting that class with our CSS in this format: <span class=\"inline__code\">.class-name { styles }</span>. Feel free to play around with these different tags, options, colors, and styles to create your own unique page!\r\n\r\n<h3>Note: For more information on CSS and some of the styling options available, <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/Css/\" target=\"_blank\">check out this tutorial</a>.</h3>","Where\'s Waldo? - Part One","","inherit","closed","closed","","41-revision-v1","","","2017-10-25 20:11:23","2017-10-25 20:11:23","",41,"http://evingrost.dev/41-revision-v1/",0,"revision","",0),

Just name the file what you\'d like and place it somewhere inside of your project where you will remember it.</h3>\r\n\r\nIn the head tag, we\'re just telling the program what we would like the title of our page to be, and which files we would like connected to this HTML file, the CSS stylesheet, and our Javascript file.\r\n\r\nWithin the body and wrapper divs, we have the label of what level we\'re on, in this case level 1, and the image we would like the player to search. There are hundreds of Where\'s Waldo images we can use, so pick one that you like!\r\n\r\nFinally, our \"modal\" div will contain the structure we need in order to show the window that will pop up after the user has found Waldo. It will contain the amount of time it took for the user to find Waldo, a short message confirming they found Waldo, and two buttons, \"Next Puzzle\", and \"High Scores\". Notice the \"high score\" modal is exactly the same as the modal content block, just with a few different names.\r\n\r\n<h2>Time for Some Cascading Style</h2>\r\n\r\nNow we\'ll take a look at the CSS file, or Cascading Style Sheet.

Just name the file what you\'d like and place it somewhere inside of your project where you will remember it.</h3>\r\n\r\nIn the head tag, we\'re just telling the program what we would like the title of our page to be, and which files we would like connected to this HTML file, the CSS stylesheet, and our Javascript file.\r\n\r\nWithin the body and wrapper divs, we have the label of what level we\'re on, in this case level 1, and the image we would like the player to search. There are hundreds of Where\'s Waldo images we can use, so pick one that you like!\r\n\r\nFinally, our \"modal\" div will contain the structure we need in order to show the window that will pop up after the user has found Waldo. It will contain the amount of time it took for the user to find Waldo, a short message confirming they found Waldo, and two buttons, \"Next Puzzle\", and \"High Scores\". Notice the \"high score\" modal is exactly the same as the modal content block, just with a few different names.\r\n\r\n<h2>Time for Some Cascading Style</h2>\r\n\r\nNow we\'ll take a look at the CSS file, or Cascading Style Sheet. This file allows us to format our HTML elements and make them look nice, and stay where we want them to on the page. Take a look through the file below:\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">body {\r\n   width: 800px;\r\n   margin-right: auto;\r\n   margin-left: auto;\r\n   background-color: rgb(255, 248, 209);\r\n   background-image: url(\"images/WaldoBG.jpg\");\r\n   background-position: center;\r\n   background-size: cover;\r\n   background-repeat: no-repeat;\r\n   height: 100%;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.wrapper {\r\n   background-color: rgba(255, 250, 224, 0.7);\r\n   padding-left: 10px;\r\n   padding-right: 10px;\r\n   padding-bottom: 10px;\r\n   margin-top: -3000px;\r\n   margin-bottom: -10px;\r\n   padding-top: 3000px;\r\n   box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px #918952;\r\n   min-height: 100%;\r\n}\r\n\r\nh1 {\r\n   font-family: sans-serif;\r\n   text-align: center;\r\n   color: #4c4c4c;\r\n}\r\n\r\np {\r\n   font-family: sans-serif;\r\n   text-align: justify;\r\n   padding-right: 10px;\r\n   padding-left: 10px;\r\n   color: #4c4c4c;\r\n}\r\n\r\ninput[type=submit] {\r\n   display: block;\r\n   width: 120px;\r\n   height: 60px;\r\n   font-family: sans-serif;\r\n   font-size: 1.2em;\r\n   text-align: center;\r\n   color: white;\r\n   background-color: #e61934;\r\n   border: none;\r\n   border-radius: 10px;\r\n   margin-right: auto;\r\n   margin-left: auto;\r\n   text-decoration: none;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#waldoBasic {\r\n   display: block;\r\n   width: 250px;\r\n   margin-left: auto;\r\n   margin-right: auto;\r\n   border-style: dashed;\r\n   border-width: 2px;\r\n   border-color: black;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.searchImage {\r\n   display: block;\r\n   width: 750px;\r\n   margin-left: auto;\r\n   margin-right: auto;\r\n   box-shadow: 0px 0px 8px black;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#timeLapsed {\r\n   display: none;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#modal{\r\n   background: rgba(0,0,0,0.5);\r\n   position: fixed;\r\n   z-index: 9950;\r\n   width: 100vw;\r\n   height: 100vh;\r\n   top: 0;\r\n   left: 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#modalContent {\r\n   width: 600px;\r\n   height: 350px;\r\n   position: fixed;\r\n   z-index: 9999;\r\n   left: 50%;\r\n   top: 50%;\r\n   margin-left: -350px;\r\n   margin-top: -250px;\r\n   background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8);\r\n   border: 1px solid #ccc;\r\n   padding: 120px 30px 30px 30px;\r\n   box-shadow: 0px 0px 12px black;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#modalHighScore {\r\n   width: 600px;\r\n   height: 350px;\r\n   position: fixed;\r\n   z-index: 9999;\r\n   left: 50%;\r\n   top: 50%;\r\n   margin-left: -350px;\r\n   margin-top: -250px;\r\n   background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8);\r\n   border: 1px solid #ccc;\r\n   padding: 20px 30px 30px 30px;\r\n   box-shadow: 0px 0px 12px black;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#modalMessage {\r\n   font-family: sans-serif;\r\n   font-size: 3em;\r\n   line-height: 1.5em;\r\n   text-align: center;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#modalHighScoresTitle {\r\n   font-family: sans-serif;\r\n   font-size: 3em;\r\n   line-height: 1.5em;\r\n   text-align: center;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#actualHighScores {\r\n   font-family: sans-serif;\r\n   font-size: 1.5em;\r\n   text-align: center;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#modalNext input[type=submit]{\r\n   display: block;\r\n   position: absolute;\r\n   bottom: 20px;\r\n   right: 20px;\r\n   width: 180px;\r\n   height: 70px;\r\n   font-family: sans-serif;\r\n   font-size: 1.7em;\r\n   text-align: center;\r\n   padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;\r\n   color: white;\r\n   background-color: #e61934;\r\n   border: none;\r\n   border-radius: 10px;\r\n   margin-right: auto;\r\n   margin-left: auto;\r\n   text-decoration: none;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#modalHighScoreButton input[type=submit]{\r\n   display: block;\r\n   position: absolute;\r\n   bottom: 20px;\r\n   left: 20px;\r\n   width: 180px;\r\n   height: 70px;\r\n   font-family: sans-serif;\r\n   font-size: 1.7em;\r\n   text-align: center;\r\n   padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;\r\n   color: white;\r\n   background-color: #2483e2;\r\n   border: none;\r\n   border-radius: 10px;\r\n   margin-right: auto;\r\n   margin-left: auto;\r\n   text-decoration: none;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#modalTimer {\r\n   text-align: center;\r\n   font-family: sans-serif;\r\n   font-weight: bold;\r\n   font-size: 5em;\r\n   line-height: 2em;\r\n   text-shadow: -1px 0 yellow, 0 1px yellow, 1px 0 yellow, 0 -1px yellow;\r\n   -webkit-transform:scale(1,1.5); /* Safari and Chrome */\r\n   -moz-transform:scale(1,1.5); /* Firefox */\r\n   -ms-transform:scale(1,1.5); /* IE 9 */\r\n   -o-transform:scale(1,1.5); /* Opera */\r\n   transform:scale(1,1.5); /* W3C */\r\n}</span></pre>\r\n\r\nAt first, this file may look a bit intimidating, but don\'t worry! It\'s very repetitive. Let\'s break it down:\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">body {\r\n   width: 800px;\r\n   margin-right: auto;\r\n   margin-left: auto;\r\n   background-color: rgb(255, 248, 209);\r\n   background-image: url(\"images/WaldoBG.jpg\");\r\n   background-position: center;\r\n   background-size: cover;\r\n   background-repeat: no-repeat;\r\n   height: 100%;\r\n}\r\n</span></pre>\r\n\r\nIn CSS, each tag targets an HTML element, and styles that element to the specifications in the CSS. So in this example, the width of the HTML element \"body\" has been set to 800 pixels, the background color has been set to a pale yellow, and the body\'s alignment is centered, using the \"margin-left: auto\" and \"margin-right: auto\" lines. We can apply these principles universally by targeting whatevera element we want (h1, p, a, etc.), and styling the aspects of that tag in the way we want. We can even create custom style-types easily by entering div tags in our HTML file with a custom class name, then targeting that class with our CSS in this format: <span class=\"inline__code\">.class-name { styles }</span>. Feel free to play around with these different tags, options, colors, and styles to create your own unique page!\r\n\r\n<h3>Note: For more information on CSS and some of the styling options available, <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/Css/\" target=\"_blank\">check out this tutorial</a>.</h3>","Where\'s Waldo? - Part One","","inherit","closed","closed","","41-revision-v1","","","2017-10-25 20:59:13","2017-10-25 20:59:13","",41,"http://evingrost.dev/41-revision-v1/",0,"revision","",0),

It\'s quite a bit more complicated than the previous areas of code, so we\'ll take it slow and break it down into bite-size pieces.\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">window.addEventListener(\'load\', function(){\r\n  \r\n});</span></pre>\r\n\r\nThe first step is to put all of our javascript code into this function. All lines of code from here on will be between these brackets. This line of code executes everything inside of it <strong>after</strong> the page has loaded. This will be important because as soon as the user reaches this page, we will be starting a timer that will measure how long it takes for them to find Waldo. We want the timer to start as soon as the image is loaded, not before, so it is important that we keep everything inside this function.\r\n\r\nNow we need to make a plan of goals that we want to accomplish with our javascript. What is it that we need to do in order to make our game work correctly? I find it helpful to make a list of all the things I need to do:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>We will need to set up a server containing the range of x- and y-coordinates that will register as correct if the user clicks within that range. This will need to be set up in Ruby, so we will do this after we finish the javascript.</li>\r\n 	<li>Start a timer on loading the page.</li>\r\n 	<li>When the user clicks on the image, find the x- and y-coordinates of where they clicked.</li>\r\n 	<li>Send the x- and y-coordinates to the server and let it decide whether they are within the correct range.</li>\r\n 	<li>Trigger the modal to become visible when the user finds Waldo.</li>\r\n 	<li>End the timer when the user finds Waldo.</li>\r\n 	<li>Convert the amount of time passed into a readable format so the user can see how much time it took to find Waldo.</li>\r\n 	<li>Fill the modal with the user\'s time.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nLet\'s start with something easy: starting the timer. In order to start the timer, all we need is one line:\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">var startTimer = Date.now();</span></pre>\r\n\r\nThis line will give us the number of milliseconds that have passed since 1/1/1970. How does that help us? Well, when the user finds Waldo and clicks on him, we\'ll mark the number of milliseconds that have passed again, and subtract the original amount. This will give us the number of milliseconds that have passed since the timer started, which is all we need to know!\r\n\r\nNow let\'s get the x- and y-coordinates of where the user clicked:\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">function getXY(e){\r\n   var xPosition = e.offsetX;\r\n   var yPosition = e.offsetY;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar picClick = document.getElementById(\"WaldoLevel1\");\r\npicClick.addEventListener(\'click\', getXY);</span></pre>\r\n\r\nNow is a good time to discuss event listeners. Whenever a user does anything, from clicking, to holding down the arrow keys, even moving the mouse, is an event. Therefore, we need to add what are called Event Listeners. Think of these as little ears that are listening for a specific event. They do nothing until the event happens, and when the event happens, they will perform a particular action.\r\n\r\nLines 5 and 6 above set up an event listener for when the user clicks on the image. When they do, the program will run the \"getXY\" function, giving us the x- and y-coordinates of where they clicked.\r\n\r\nNote that we use \"e\" here as a representative for the \"event\". In this snippet of code, \"e.offsetX\" is a pre-programmed variable within JavaScript that represents the x-coordinate of the element the user clicked on. This is important, because we don\'t want the x-coordinate of where they clicked on the screen, but rather where they clicked on the image.\r\n\r\nFor now, we\'ll leave the server-side programming on pause, so let\'s jump ahead a few steps. Let\'s pretend we\'ve sent the x- and y-coordinates to the server, and the server has come back with a \"correct answer\" response. We can set up our functions for when that happens.\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">function endTimer(){\r\n   var endingTime = Date.now();\r\n   var totalTime = endingTime - startTimer;\r\n}</span></pre>\r\n\r\nWhen the server responds that the user has the correct answer, the first thing we need to do is stop the timer. This function gives us a variable that contains the total number of milliseconds it took the player to find Waldo. This doesn\'t mean much to our user, however, so now we need to make it readable. This will be our longest piece of javascript code yet, but it\'ll all make sense when we break it down:\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">function convertToReadableTime(millis){\r\n   var timeArray = [];\r\n\r\n   var hundredths = findHundredths(millis);\r\n\r\n   var x = Math.floor(millis / 1000);\r\n   var seconds = Math.floor(x % 60);\r\n   x /= 60;\r\n   var minutes = Math.floor(x % 60);\r\n   x /= 60;\r\n   var hours = Math.floor(x % 24);\r\n   x /= 24;\r\n   var days = Math.floor(x);\r\n\r\n   timeArray.push(hundredths, seconds, minutes, hours, days);\r\n\r\n   var timeString = timeFormat(timeArray, 2);\r\n   return timeString;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction findHundredths(millis){\r\n   var secondsDecimal = millis / 1000;\r\n   var x = String(secondsDecimal);\r\n   var splitHundredths = x.split(\".\");\r\n   var bajillionHundredths = splitHundredths[1];\r\n   var newHundredths = bajillionHundredths.charAt(0) + bajillionHundredths.charAt(1);\r\n   return newHundredths;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction timeFormat(array, targetLength){\r\n\r\n   var formattedArray = [];\r\n\r\n   for(var i = 0; i < array.length; i++){\r\n      var output = array[i] + \'\';\r\n\r\n      while (output.length < targetLength) {\r\n         output = \'0\' + output;\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      formattedArray.push(output);\r\n   }\r\n   var finalTimeString = stringItTogether(formattedArray);\r\n   return finalTimeString;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction stringItTogether(arrayOfTimes){\r\n   var stringy = arrayOfTimes[4] + \":\" + arrayOfTimes[3] + \":\" + arrayOfTimes[2] + \":\" + arrayOfTimes[1] + \".\" + arrayOfTimes[0]\r\n   return stringy;\r\n}</span></pre>\r\n\r\nLet\'s start with the first function. This function takes in our milliseconds, here called \"millis\", and will break them down into the number of seconds, minutes, hours, and days. Finding hundredths of a second is a little more complicated, so we need another function for that. We\'re setting our variable \"x\" equal to our total milliseconds divided by 1000. To find the number of seconds, we use Math.floor, which will round down to the nearest whole number, instead of getting back something like 14.333333356498275492. We would just want the \"14\" out of that number.\r\n\r\nWe also use the \"%\" here instead of \"/\". This is called the modulo symbol, and this symbol gives us the remainder, instead of the division. For example, \"5/2\" will give us 2.5, whereas \"5%2\" will give us 1, because 1 is the remainder.\r\n\r\nWe then divide x by 60, and find the minutes by getting the remainder of \"x % 60\". We continue like this to get our hours and days. Now let\'s talk about the hundredths function.\r\n\r\nIn order to find the hundreths of a second that are on the timer, we have to do a little more math. We\'ll do this in the findHundredths function. After dividing the milliseconds by 1000, the decimal point is in the correct spot, i.e. \"30.456\". All we need to do is convert this to a string, then split that string by the decimal point. This will give us an array of [\"30\", \"456\"]. We need the first two numbers from the second string (this is the charAt line of code), and now we have the hundredth of a second!\r\n\r\nFinally, we push our hundredths, seconds, minutes, hours, and days into an array. Here\'s where we call our \"timeFormat\" function. Notice that the numbers we currently have are the lowest number of digits possible. As humans, we like to read time in double digits. 4 hours are typically read as \"04 hours\", like on a digital clock. This function will convert all of our numbers into double digits.\r\n\r\n<h4>Example: 3 minutes, 6 seconds, and 45 hundredths of a second would come in to the function as [45, 6, 3, 0, 0], and becomes [\"45\", \"06\", \"03\", \"00\", \"00\"] after the function has executed.</h4>\r\n\r\nNow, when we call the \"stringItTogether\" function, it will use the numbers in the array to a string that is readable to our user!\r\n\r\n<h4>Another example: 0 days, 4 hours, 37 minutes, 2 seconds, and 56 hundredths of a second will come out as \"00:04:37:02.56\".</h4>\r\n\r\nNow that we have our timer string, we can use it to fill in our modal!\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">function fillModal(timerString){\r\n   var modalTimerText = document.getElementById(\"modalTimer\");\r\n   modalTimerText.innerHTML = timerString;\r\n   displayModal();\r\n}</span></pre>\r\n\r\nIf you take a quick look back in our HTML, we set ourselves up for success by creating that modal content block. Within that tag, we also have a \"modalTimer\" tag, which we can use to input our timer string, and our modal will do all the heavy lifting for us. So, all we need to do is target that tag, as we do in line 2, then fill the innerHTML with that high score string. Our CSS will style the font, size, color, etc. the way we want, and we can move on to displaying the modal.\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">function displayModal(){\r\n   var modal = document.getElementById(\"modal\");\r\n   var modalContent = document.getElementById(\"modalContent\");\r\n   var modalHighScores = document.getElementById(\"modalHighScores\");\r\n   modal.style.display = \"block\";\r\n   modalContent.style.display = \"block\";\r\n}</span></pre>\r\n\r\nWhen we look back in our HTML again, we\'ll see that the display of the modal blocks have been set to \"none\" as default. All we need to do to make our modal \"appear\", is to set the display to \"block\". This will place our modal over top of our page, (Note the style \"z-index\" in the CSS style sheet, which indicates the order from front to back of each tag.), and make it visible for the user to interact with.\r\n\r\nNow let\'s have some fun with server-side code!","Where\'s Waldo? - Part Two","","publish","open","open","","wheres-waldo-part-two","","","2017-10-27 14:11:04","2017-10-27 14:11:04","",0,"http://evingrost.dev/?p=50",0,"post","",0),

It\'s quite a bit more complicated than the previous areas of code, so we\'ll take it slow and break it down into bite-size pieces.\n\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">window.addEventListener(\'load\', function(){\n  \n});</span></pre>\n\nThe first step is to put all of our javascript code into this function. All lines of code from here on will be between these brackets. This line of code executes everything inside of it <strong>after</strong> the page has loaded. This will be important because as soon as the user reaches this page, we will be starting a timer that will measure how long it takes for them to find Waldo. We want the timer to start as soon as the image is loaded, not before, so it is important that we keep everything inside this function.\n\nNow we need to make a plan of goals that we want to accomplish with our javascript. What is it that we need to do in order to make our game work correctly? I find it helpful to make a list of all the things I need to do:\n\n<ul>\n 	<li>We will need to set up a server containing the range of x- and y-coordinates that will register as correct if the user clicks within that range. This will need to be set up in Ruby, so we will do this after we finish the javascript.</li>\n 	<li>Start a timer on loading the page.</li>\n 	<li>When the user clicks on the image, find the x- and y-coordinates of where they clicked.</li>\n 	<li>Send the x- and y-coordinates to the server and let it decide whether they are within the correct range.</li>\n 	<li>Trigger the modal to become visible when the user finds Waldo.</li>\n 	<li>End the timer when the user finds Waldo.</li>\n 	<li>Convert the amount of time passed into a readable format so the user can see how much time it took to find Waldo.</li>\n 	<li>Fill the modal with the user\'s time.</li>\n</ul>\n\nLet\'s start with something easy: starting the timer. In order to start the timer, all we need is one line:\n\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">var startTimer = Date.now();</span></pre>\n\nThis line will give us the number of milliseconds that have passed since 1/1/1970. How does that help us? Well, when the user finds Waldo and clicks on him, we\'ll mark the number of milliseconds that have passed again, and subtract the original amount. This will give us the number of milliseconds that have passed since the timer started, which is all we need to know!\n\nNow let\'s get the x- and y-coordinates of where the user clicked:\n\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">function getXY(e){\n   var xPosition = e.offsetX;\n   var yPosition = e.offsetY;\n}\n\nvar picClick = document.getElementById(\"WaldoLevel1\");\npicClick.addEventListener(\'click\', getXY);</span></pre>\n\nNow is a good time to discuss event listeners. Whenever a user does anything, from clicking, to holding down the arrow keys, even moving the mouse, is an event. Therefore, we need to add what are called Event Listeners. Think of these as little ears that are listening for a specific event. They do nothing until the event happens, and when the event happens, they will perform a particular action.\n\nLines 5 and 6 above set up an event listener for when the user clicks on the image. When they do, the program will run the \"getXY\" function, giving us the x- and y-coordinates of where they clicked.\n\nNote that we use \"e\" here as a representative for the \"event\". In this snippet of code, \"e.offsetX\" is a pre-programmed variable within JavaScript that represents the x-coordinate of the element the user clicked on. This is important, because we don\'t want the x-coordinate of where they clicked on the screen, but rather where they clicked on the image.\n\nFor now, we\'ll leave the server-side programming on pause, so let\'s jump ahead a few steps. Let\'s pretend we\'ve sent the x- and y-coordinates to the server, and the server has come back with a \"correct answer\" response. We can set up our functions for when that happens.\n\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">function endTimer(){\n   var endingTime = Date.now();\n   var totalTime = endingTime - startTimer;\n}</span></pre>\n\nWhen the server responds that the user has the correct answer, the first thing we need to do is stop the timer. This function gives us a variable that contains the total number of milliseconds it took the player to find Waldo. This doesn\'t mean much to our user, however, so now we need to make it readable. This will be our longest piece of javascript code yet, but it\'ll all make sense when we break it down:\n\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">function convertToReadableTime(millis){\n   var timeArray = [];\n\n   var hundredths = findHundredths(millis);\n\n   var x = Math.floor(millis / 1000);\n   var seconds = Math.floor(x % 60);\n   x /= 60;\n   var minutes = Math.floor(x % 60);\n   x /= 60;\n   var hours = Math.floor(x % 24);\n   x /= 24;\n   var days = Math.floor(x);\n\n   timeArray.push(hundredths, seconds, minutes, hours, days);\n\n   var timeString = timeFormat(timeArray, 2);\n   return timeString;\n}\n\nfunction findHundredths(millis){\n   var secondsDecimal = millis / 1000;\n   var x = String(secondsDecimal);\n   var splitHundredths = x.split(\".\");\n   var bajillionHundredths = splitHundredths[1];\n   var newHundredths = bajillionHundredths.charAt(0) + bajillionHundredths.charAt(1);\n   return newHundredths;\n}\n\nfunction timeFormat(array, targetLength){\n\n   var formattedArray = [];\n\n   for(var i = 0; i < array.length; i++){\n      var output = array[i] + \'\';\n\n      while (output.length < targetLength) {\n         output = \'0\' + output;\n      }\n\n      formattedArray.push(output);\n   }\n   var finalTimeString = stringItTogether(formattedArray);\n   return finalTimeString;\n}\n\nfunction stringItTogether(arrayOfTimes){\n   var stringy = arrayOfTimes[4] + \":\" + arrayOfTimes[3] + \":\" + arrayOfTimes[2] + \":\" + arrayOfTimes[1] + \".\" + arrayOfTimes[0]\n   return stringy;\n}</span></pre>\n\nLet\'s start with the first function. This function takes in our milliseconds, here called \"millis\", and will break them down into the number of seconds, minutes, hours, and days. Finding hundredths of a second is a little more complicated, so we need another function for that. We\'re setting our variable \"x\" equal to our total milliseconds divided by 1000. To find the number of seconds, we use Math.floor, which will round down to the nearest whole number, instead of getting back something like 14.333333356498275492. We would just want the \"14\" out of that number.\n\nWe also use the \"%\" here instead of \"/\". This is called the modulo symbol, and this symbol gives us the remainder, instead of the division. For example, \"5/2\" will give us 2.5, whereas \"5%2\" will give us 1, because 1 is the remainder.\n\nWe then divide x by 60, and find the minutes by getting the remainder of \"x % 60\". We continue like this to get our hours and days. Now let\'s talk about the hundredths function.\n\nIn order to find the hundreths of a second that are on the timer, we have to do a little more math. We\'ll do this in the findHundredths function. After dividing the milliseconds by 1000, the decimal point is in the correct spot, i.e. \"30.456\". All we need to do is convert this to a string, then split that string by the decimal point. This will give us an array of [\"30\", \"456\"]. We need the first two numbers from the second string (this is the charAt line of code), and now we have the hundredth of a second!\n\nFinally, we push our hundredths, seconds, minutes, hours, and days into an array. Here\'s where we call our \"timeFormat\" function. Notice that the numbers we currently have are the lowest number of digits possible. As humans, we like to read time in double digits. 4 hours are typically read as \"04 hours\", like on a digital clock. This function will convert all of our numbers into double digits.\n\n<h4>Example: 3 minutes, 6 seconds, and 45 hundredths of a second would come in to the function as [45, 6, 3, 0, 0], and becomes [\"45\", \"06\", \"03\", \"00\", \"00\"] after the function has executed.</h4>\n\nNow, when we call the \"stringItTogether\" function, it will use the numbers in the array to a string that is readable to our user!\n\n<h4>Another example: 0 days, 4 hours, 37 minutes, 2 seconds, and 56 hundredths of a second will come out as \"00:04:37:02.56\".</h4>\n\nNow that we have our timer string, we can use it to fill in our modal!\n\n","Where\'s Waldo? - Part Two","","inherit","closed","closed","","50-autosave-v1","","","2017-10-25 21:32:41","2017-10-25 21:32:41","",50,"http://evingrost.dev/50-autosave-v1/",0,"revision","",0),

Within that tag, we also have a \"modalTimer\" tag, which we can use to input our timer string, and our modal will do all the heavy lifting for us. So, all we need to do is target that tag, as we do in line 2, then fill the innerHTML with that high score string. Our CSS will style the font, size, color, etc. the way we want, and we can move on to displaying the modal.\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">function displayModal(){\r\n   var modal = document.getElementById(\"modal\");\r\n   var modalContent = document.getElementById(\"modalContent\");\r\n   var modalHighScores = document.getElementById(\"modalHighScores\");\r\n   modal.style.display = \"block\";\r\n   modalContent.style.display = \"block\";\r\n}</span></pre>\r\n\r\nWhen we look back in our HTML again, we\'ll see that the display of the modal blocks have been set to \"none\" as default. All we need to do to make our modal \"appear\", is to set the display to \"block\". This will place our modal over top of our page, (Note the style \"z-index\" in the CSS style sheet, which indicates the order from front to back of each tag.), and make it visible for the user to interact with.\r\n\r\nNow let\'s have some fun with server-side code!","Where\'s Waldo? - Part Two","","inherit","closed","closed","","50-revision-v1","","","2017-10-25 21:34:10","2017-10-25 21:34:10","",50,"http://evingrost.dev/50-revision-v1/",0,"revision","",0),
(56,1,"2017-10-25 23:59:01","2017-10-25 23:59:01","For this section of the tutorial, we will be building our server with a Ruby gem called \"Sinatra\". Sinatra is a fantastic gem that allows us to get up and running quickly and easily with a local host server. This will be the back-end powerhouse that does all of the heavy lifting for our Where\'s Waldo game. While servers can certainly be intimidating for new developers (and experienced coders as well!), Sinatra makes this step very user friendly.\r\n\r\nI\'ll have to assume that you have both <a href=\"https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Ruby</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sinatrarb.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sinatra</a> installed on your computer at this point in the tutorial. If you do not currently have these installed, head over <a href=\"https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> for help installing Ruby, and <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/jump-start-sinatra/online/ch01s02\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to install Sinatra.\r\n\r\nThere are a few things that we need to do before we start coding in Sinatra. Sinatra has a very particular folder and file structure that we must adhere to for our site to work, so let\'s set that up now. Your folder structure should be set up like this:\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">      <img src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/foldericon.png\" alt=\"Folder Icon\" class=\"l-folder__icon\"> Waldo\r\n       <img src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/arrow.png\" alt=\"arrow\" class=\"l-folder__icon\"> <img src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/foldericon.png\"  alt=\"Folder Icon\" class=\"l-folder__icon\"> public\r\n             <img src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/arrow.png\" alt=\"arrow\" class=\"l-folder__icon\"> <img src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/foldericon.png\"  alt=\"Folder Icon\" class=\"l-folder__icon\"> images\r\n       <img src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/arrow.png\" alt=\"arrow\" class=\"l-folder__icon\"> <img src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/foldericon.png\"  alt=\"Folder Icon\" class=\"l-folder__icon\"> views</span></pre>\r\n\r\nOur Ruby files will go in the general \"Waldo\" folder, while our helper files such as our CSS stylesheet, JavaScript files, and images folder will go into the \"public\" folder. Our \"views\" folder will contain our individual page files, like the home page and Waldo game pages. Keep in mind that we must adhere to this folder structure exactly, because these are the paths that Sinatra will automatically look in for each file type. If that folder does not exist, or if the file is in the wrong folder, we will get an error message and our site will not run properly.\r\n\r\n<h2>Creating a Gem of a Server</h2>\r\n\r\nNow, we are going to build our server with Sinatra. Lucky for us, Sinatra makes this very simple! Create a new ruby file (<em>file-name.rb</em>) inside of your general \"Waldo\" folder. Here, I call my file \"webController\", but you may use any naming convention that makes sense to you. Inside of that file, write the following few lines of code:\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">require \'sinatra\'\r\nrequire \'pry\'\r\nrequire \'CSV\'\r\nrequire_relative \'csvMaker.rb\'\r\n\r\nget(\"/\"){\r\n   erb :index\r\n}</span></pre>\r\n\r\nRemember that HTML file that we started with? We\'ll need to modify it very slightly to get it to work in Sinatra. Sinatra does not deal with simple <em>.html</em> files, it prefers to use <em>.erb</em> files, which is short for the \"embedded ruby\" file type. This essentially means that we can use ruby code inside of HTML files. For now, we\'ll stick with HTML only in our <em>.erb</em> file, but it\'s nice to know that it has greater capabilities than that.\r\n\r\nWherever you created your original HTML file, make a copy of it and place that copy into your \"views\" folder, and we\'ll need to rename it to \"index.erb\". This way, Sinatra will be able to identify it as our index HTML file.\r\n\r\n<h2>Testing, Testing</h2>\r\n\r\nAt this point, we want to test that our Sinatra server is working. In your command line, get inside of your general \"Waldo\" folder, and type in this line of code: \"ruby webController.rb\", or if you named your ruby file something else, you\'ll need to use that name instead. You should see several lines of code that start with a time stamp, and \"INFO\", then some more code.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"l-image__centered--medium\" src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/RubySS.png\" alt=\"Ruby Terminal Screenshot\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Note: Your server is running from your computer at this point, and it does not refresh itself when you make changes to your files. To close the server, press Ctrl+C inside your terminal. If you\'d like to restart the server and view any changes you\'ve made, close the server and restart it by running your \"ruby webController\" command again.

We\'ll need to modify it very slightly to get it to work in Sinatra. Sinatra does not deal with simple <em>.html</em> files, it prefers to use <em>.erb</em> files, which is short for the \"embedded ruby\" file type. This essentially means that we can use ruby code inside of HTML files. For now, we\'ll stick with HTML only in our <em>.erb</em> file, but it\'s nice to know that it has greater capabilities than that.\n\nWherever you created your original HTML file, make a copy of it and place that copy into your \"views\" folder, and we\'ll need to rename it to \"index.erb\". This way, Sinatra will be able to identify it as our index HTML file.\n\n<h2>Testing, Testing</h2>\n\nAt this point, we want to test that our Sinatra server is working. In your command line, get inside of your general \"Waldo\" folder, and type in this line of code: \"ruby webController.rb\", or if you named your ruby file something else, you\'ll need to use that name instead.

Our \"views\" folder will contain our individual page files, like the home page and Waldo game pages. Keep in mind that we must adhere to this folder structure exactly, because these are the paths that Sinatra will automatically look in for each file type. If that folder does not exist, or if the file is in the wrong folder, we will get an error message and our site will not run properly.\r\n\r\nNow, we are going to build our server with Sinatra. Lucky for us, Sinatra makes this very simple! Create a new ruby file (<em>file-name.rb</em>) inside of your general \"Waldo\" folder. Here, I call my file \"webController\", but you may use any naming convention that makes sense to you. Inside of that file, write the following few lines of code:\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">require \'sinatra\'\r\nrequire \'pry\'\r\nrequire \'CSV\'\r\nrequire_relative \'csvMaker.rb\'\r\n\r\nget(\"/\"){\r\n   erb :index\r\n}</span></pre>\r\n\r\nRemember that HTML file that we started with? We\'ll need to modify it very slightly to get it to work in Sinatra. Sinatra does not deal with simple <em>.html</em> files, it prefers to use <em>.erb</em> files, which is short for the \"embedded ruby\" file type. This essentially means that we can use ruby code inside of HTML files. For now, we\'ll stick with HTML only in our <em>.erb</em> file, but it\'s nice to know that it has greater capabilities than that.\r\n\r\nWherever you created your original HTML file, make a copy of it and place that copy into your \"views\" folder, and we\'ll need to rename it to \"index.erb\". This way, Sinatra will be able to identify it as our index HTML file.\r\n\r\n<h2>Testing, Testing</h2>\r\n\r\nAt this point, we want to test that our Sinatra server is working. In your command line, get inside of your general \"Waldo\" folder, and type in this line of code: \"ruby webController.rb\", or if you named your ruby file something else, you\'ll need to use that name instead. You should see several lines of code that start with a time stamp, and \"INFO\", then some more code.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"l-image__centered--medium\" src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/RubySS-300x119.png\" alt=\"Ruby Terminal Screenshot\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Note: Your server is running from your computer at this point, and it does not refresh itself when you make changes to your files.

Sinatra has a very particular folder and file structure that we must adhere to for our site to work, so let\'s set that up now. Your folder structure should be set up like this:\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">      <img src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/foldericon.png\" alt=\"Folder Icon\" class=\"l-folder__icon\"> Waldo\r\n       <img src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/arrow.png\" alt=\"arrow\" class=\"l-folder__icon\"> <img src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/foldericon.png\"  alt=\"Folder Icon\" class=\"l-folder__icon\"> public\r\n             <img src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/arrow.png\" alt=\"arrow\" class=\"l-folder__icon\"> <img src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/foldericon.png\"  alt=\"Folder Icon\" class=\"l-folder__icon\"> images\r\n       <img src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/arrow.png\" alt=\"arrow\" class=\"l-folder__icon\"> <img src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/foldericon.png\"  alt=\"Folder Icon\" class=\"l-folder__icon\"> views</span></pre>\r\n\r\nOur Ruby files will go in the general \"Waldo\" folder, while our helper files such as our CSS stylesheet, JavaScript files, and images folder will go into the \"public\" folder. Our \"views\" folder will contain our individual page files, like the home page and Waldo game pages. Keep in mind that we must adhere to this folder structure exactly, because these are the paths that Sinatra will automatically look in for each file type. If that folder does not exist, or if the file is in the wrong folder, we will get an error message and our site will not run properly.\r\n\r\nNow, we are going to build our server with Sinatra. Lucky for us, Sinatra makes this very simple! Create a new ruby file (<em>file-name.rb</em>) inside of your general \"Waldo\" folder. Here, I call my file \"webController\", but you may use any naming convention that makes sense to you. Inside of that file, write the following few lines of code:\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">require \'sinatra\'\r\nrequire \'pry\'\r\nrequire \'CSV\'\r\nrequire_relative \'csvMaker.rb\'\r\n\r\nget(\"/\"){\r\n   erb :index\r\n}</span></pre>\r\n\r\nRemember that HTML file that we started with? We\'ll need to modify it very slightly to get it to work in Sinatra. Sinatra does not deal with simple <em>.html</em> files, it prefers to use <em>.erb</em> files, which is short for the \"embedded ruby\" file type. This essentially means that we can use ruby code inside of HTML files. For now, we\'ll stick with HTML only in our <em>.erb</em> file, but it\'s nice to know that it has greater capabilities than that.\r\n\r\nWherever you created your original HTML file, make a copy of it and place that copy into your \"views\" folder, and we\'ll need to rename it to \"index.erb\".

(78,1,"2017-10-26 13:31:17","2017-10-26 13:31:17","For this section of the tutorial, we will be building our server with a Ruby gem called \"Sinatra\". Sinatra is a fantastic gem that allows us to get up and running quickly and easily with a local host server. This will be the back-end powerhouse that does all of the heavy lifting for our Where\'s Waldo game. While servers can certainly be intimidating for new developers (and experienced coders as well!), Sinatra makes this step very user friendly.\r\n\r\nI\'ll have to assume that you have both <a href=\"https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Ruby</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sinatrarb.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sinatra</a> installed on your computer at this point in the tutorial. If you do not currently have these installed, head over <a href=\"https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> for help installing Ruby, and <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/jump-start-sinatra/online/ch01s02\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to install Sinatra.\r\n\r\nThere are a few things that we need to do before we start coding in Sinatra. Sinatra has a very particular folder and file structure that we must adhere to for our site to work, so let\'s set that up now. Your folder structure should be set up like this:\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">      <img src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/foldericon.png\" alt=\"Folder Icon\" class=\"l-folder__icon\"> Waldo\r\n       <img src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/arrow.png\" alt=\"arrow\" class=\"l-folder__icon\"> <img src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/foldericon.png\"  alt=\"Folder Icon\" class=\"l-folder__icon\"> public\r\n             <img src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/arrow.png\" alt=\"arrow\" class=\"l-folder__icon\"> <img src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/foldericon.png\"  alt=\"Folder Icon\" class=\"l-folder__icon\"> images\r\n       <img src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/arrow.png\" alt=\"arrow\" class=\"l-folder__icon\"> <img src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/foldericon.png\"  alt=\"Folder Icon\" class=\"l-folder__icon\"> views</span></pre>\r\n\r\nOur Ruby files will go in the general \"Waldo\" folder, while our helper files such as our CSS stylesheet, JavaScript files, and images folder will go into the \"public\" folder. Our \"views\" folder will contain our individual page files, like the home page and Waldo game pages. Keep in mind that we must adhere to this folder structure exactly, because these are the paths that Sinatra will automatically look in for each file type. If that folder does not exist, or if the file is in the wrong folder, we will get an error message and our site will not run properly.\r\n\r\n<h2>Creating a Gem of a Server</h2>\r\n\r\nNow, we are going to build our server with Sinatra. Lucky for us, Sinatra makes this very simple! Create a new ruby file (<em>file-name.rb</em>) inside of your general \"Waldo\" folder. Here, I call my file \"webController\", but you may use any naming convention that makes sense to you. Inside of that file, write the following few lines of code:\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">require \'sinatra\'\r\nrequire \'pry\'\r\nrequire \'CSV\'\r\nrequire_relative \'csvMaker.rb\'\r\n\r\nget(\"/\"){\r\n   erb :index\r\n}</span></pre>\r\n\r\nRemember that HTML file that we started with? We\'ll need to modify it very slightly to get it to work in Sinatra. Sinatra does not deal with simple <em>.html</em> files, it prefers to use <em>.erb</em> files, which is short for the \"embedded ruby\" file type. This essentially means that we can use ruby code inside of HTML files. For now, we\'ll stick with HTML only in our <em>.erb</em> file, but it\'s nice to know that it has greater capabilities than that.\r\n\r\nWherever you created your original HTML file, make a copy of it and place that copy into your \"views\" folder, and we\'ll need to rename it to \"index.erb\". This way, Sinatra will be able to identify it as our index HTML file.\r\n\r\n<h2>Testing, Testing</h2>\r\n\r\nAt this point, we want to test that our Sinatra server is working. In your command line, get inside of your general \"Waldo\" folder, and type in this line of code: \"ruby webController.rb\", or if you named your ruby file something else, you\'ll need to use that name instead. You should see several lines of code that start with a time stamp, and \"INFO\", then some more code.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"l-image__centered--medium\" src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/RubySS.png\" alt=\"Ruby Terminal Screenshot\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Note: Your server is running from your computer at this point, and it does not refresh itself when you make changes to your files. To close the server, press Ctrl+C inside your terminal. If you\'d like to restart the server and view any changes you\'ve made, close the server and restart it by running your \"ruby webController\" command again. You will need to refresh your browser to see any changes.</h3>\r\n\r\nThis means your server is currently running, and we can check out our website by opening our browser of choice and typing \"localhost:4567\" into the URL. You should see your website up-and-running!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/WaldoSS.png\" alt=\"Waldo Game Screenshot\" class=\"l-image__centered--large\" />\r\n\r\nThough our website is visible at this point, you\'ll notice that our game doesn\'t actually work.

We\'ll use our server to verify if the correct coordinates were clicked, then give feedback to the user once they\'ve found Waldo and won the game. Let\'s get started.\r\n\r\n<h2>A Coordinated Effort</h2>\r\n\r\nAs of now, we have no way of verifying whether the x- and y-coordinates that are sent to the server are correct. In order to solve this issue, we\'ll need to write a simple function in Ruby. We\'ll want to create a new ruby file within our general \"Waldo\" folder, and name it what you\'d like. Here, I call mine \"rubyFunctions.rb\".\r\n\r\nAfter we\'ve made our file, we need to find out the range of x- and y-coordinates that are acceptable for the user to click on to be considered a \"hit\" for Waldo. This can be done in many ways. There are websites that will show you the x- and y-coordinates of where you click on an uploaded image, or you can simply <span class=\"inline__code\">console.log(e.offsetX + \",\" + e.offsetY);</span> and click on the corners of Waldo to find the range of acceptable coordinates. In the case of this image, the range of acceptable x-coordinates are 380 - 419, and y-coordinates are 262-302.\r\n\r\nNow that we know the acceptable coordinate range, we can build our validation function in ruby. In your \"rubyFunctions.rb\" file, enter the following code:\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">def validateXY(x, y)\r\n   intX = x.to_i\r\n   intY = y.to_i\r\n   if (intX &gt; 380) &amp;&amp; (intX &lt; 419) &amp;&amp; (intY &gt; 262) &amp;&amp; (intY &lt; 302)\r\n      return true\r\n   else\r\n      return false\r\n   end\r\nend</span></pre>\r\n\r\nThis simply means that if the coordinates received are within the correct range, return \"true\". If not, return \"false\". Nice and simple!\r\n\r\nHowever, we\'re not done with this step yet. We\'ve set up a validation function, but how do we actually pass our x- and y-coordinates into that function and get the answer back? Let\'s start with the JavaScript.\r\n\r\nEarlier, we talked about how to get the x- and y-coordinates in JavaScript, but we skipped ahead before sending them to the server. In our JS file, we\'ll need to modify our \"getXY\" function in order to call a new \"sendInfoToServer\" function. I\'ve commented the next bit of code line-by-line as it gets a bit complicated:\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\"><span class=\"code__comment\">// This function gets the X and Y coordinates of where the</span>\r\n<span class=\"code__comment\">// user clicked, relative to the image.</span>\r\n   function getXY(e){\r\n      var xPosition = e.offsetX;\r\n      var yPosition = e.offsetY;\r\n      <span class=\"code__comment\">// Sending x and y to the server.</span>\r\n      sendInfoToServer(xPosition, yPosition);\r\n   }\r\n\r\n<span class=\"code__comment\">// Takes the x and y coordinates, passed from the getXY</span>\r\n<span class=\"code__comment\">// function, and sends them to the server to determine whether</span>\r\n<span class=\"code__comment\">// or not these coordinates are correct for Waldo.</span>\r\nfunction sendInfoToServer(x, y){\r\n   <span class=\"code__comment\">// Making a new request.</span>\r\n   var xyRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();\r\n   <span class=\"code__comment\">// This line passes our x and y coordinates into a query</span>\r\n   <span class=\"code__comment\">// string that Sinatra can use and determine what to do with.</span>\r\n   xyRequest.open(\'GET\', \'http://localhost:4567/puzzle01validate?xPos=\' + x + \'&amp;yPos=\' + y);\r\n   <span class=\"code__comment\">// The \"onload\" function executes when the server responds that</span>\r\n   <span class=\"code__comment\">// it received the request. It does what it is instructed to do</span>\r\n   <span class=\"code__comment\">// with those coordinates.</span>\r\n   <span class=\"code__comment\">// Example: If a user clicks \"like\" on a facebook post, when</span>\r\n   <span class=\"code__comment\">// the server responds that it received the request, it will</span>\r\n   <span class=\"code__comment\">// update the number of likes on that post.</span>\r\n   xyRequest.onload = saveScore;\r\n   <span class=\"code__comment\">//This line sends our request.</span>\r\n   xyRequest.send();\r\n}</span></pre>\r\n\r\nXMLHttpRequest is a function that is built into JS, which allows us to send and recieve information to and from a server. For an in-depth tutorial on how this works, check out <a href=\"https://youtu.be/rJesac0_Ftw\" target=\"_blank\">this video</a>. For now, all we need to know is that we are sending our coordinates to our Sinatra controller through something called a query string. A query string comes through to the server like this: <span class=\"inline__code\">http://localhost:4567/puzzle01validate?xPos=394&amp;yPos=280</span>.\r\n\r\nNow, when our server receives this query string, it will let us know whether the coordinates are \"true\", within the correct range, or \"false\", not within the correct range.\r\n\r\nAs of now, you technically have a working game of Where\'s Waldo! The problem is, there is no visual confirmation that the user got it right when they click on Waldo. The final touch will be in our JavaScript file.\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">function saveScore(e){\r\n   var response = false;\r\n  \r\n   if (e.target.responseText === \"true\"){\r\n      response = true;\r\n   }\r\n  \r\n   <span class=\"code__comment\">// This if statement checks to see if \"didYouFindWaldo\"</span>\r\n   <span class=\"code__comment\">// returns true. If so, we move on to stop the timer.</span>\r\n   if (response === true){\r\n      timerData = endTimer();\r\n   }\r\n}</pre></span>\r\n\r\nNow, when the server sends back that the coordinates are true, our JavaScript will fill the modal with the user\'s time, and they\'ll win the game!\r\n\r\nThere are so many things you can do with this game to turn it into a polished, multi-page game that your friends and family can play. Try adding new pages, buttons to go to the next or previous page, and if you\'re really ambitious, try adding a high-score tracker! Play around with the code, get it working the way you want it to, and have fun!","Where\'s Waldo? - Part Four","","publish","open","open","","wheres-waldo-part-four","","","2017-10-27 14:57:36","2017-10-27 14:57:36","",0,"http://evingrost.dev/?p=79",0,"post","",0),

(83,1,"2017-10-27 14:08:06","2017-10-27 14:08:06","<h2>Taking Action with Javascript</h2>\r\n\r\nJavascript is the language we use to make our websites dynamic and interactive. It\'s quite a bit more complicated than the previous areas of code, so we\'ll take it slow and break it down into bite-size pieces.\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">window.addEventListener(\'load\', function(){\r\n  \r\n});</span></pre>\r\n\r\nThe first step is to put all of our javascript code into this function. All lines of code from here on will be between these brackets. This line of code executes everything inside of it <strong>after</strong> the page has loaded. This will be important because as soon as the user reaches this page, we will be starting a timer that will measure how long it takes for them to find Waldo. We want the timer to start as soon as the image is loaded, not before, so it is important that we keep everything inside this function.\r\n\r\nNow we need to make a plan of goals that we want to accomplish with our javascript. What is it that we need to do in order to make our game work correctly? I find it helpful to make a list of all the things I need to do:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>We will need to set up a server containing the range of x- and y-coordinates that will register as correct if the user clicks within that range. This will need to be set up in Ruby, so we will do this after we finish the javascript.</li>\r\n 	<li>Start a timer on loading the page.</li>\r\n 	<li>When the user clicks on the image, find the x- and y-coordinates of where they clicked.</li>\r\n 	<li>Send the x- and y-coordinates to the server and let it decide whether they are within the correct range.</li>\r\n 	<li>Trigger the modal to become visible when the user finds Waldo.</li>\r\n 	<li>End the timer when the user finds Waldo.</li>\r\n 	<li>Convert the amount of time passed into a readable format so the user can see how much time it took to find Waldo.</li>\r\n 	<li>Fill the modal with the user\'s time.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nLet\'s start with something easy: starting the timer. In order to start the timer, all we need is one line:\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">var startTimer = Date.now();</span></pre>\r\n\r\nThis line will give us the number of milliseconds that have passed since 1/1/1970. How does that help us? Well, when the user finds Waldo and clicks on him, we\'ll mark the number of milliseconds that have passed again, and subtract the original amount. This will give us the number of milliseconds that have passed since the timer started, which is all we need to know!\r\n\r\nNow let\'s get the x- and y-coordinates of where the user clicked:\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">function getXY(e){\r\n   var xPosition = e.offsetX;\r\n   var yPosition = e.offsetY;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar picClick = document.getElementById(\"WaldoLevel1\");\r\npicClick.addEventListener(\'click\', getXY);</span></pre>\r\n\r\nNow is a good time to discuss event listeners. Whenever a user does anything, from clicking, to holding down the arrow keys, even moving the mouse, is an event. Therefore, we need to add what are called Event Listeners. Think of these as little ears that are listening for a specific event. They do nothing until the event happens, and when the event happens, they will perform a particular action.\r\n\r\nLines 5 and 6 above set up an event listener for when the user clicks on the image. When they do, the program will run the \"getXY\" function, giving us the x- and y-coordinates of where they clicked.\r\n\r\nNote that we use \"e\" here as a representative for the \"event\". In this snippet of code, \"e.offsetX\" is a pre-programmed variable within JavaScript that represents the x-coordinate of the element the user clicked on. This is important, because we don\'t want the x-coordinate of where they clicked on the screen, but rather where they clicked on the image.\r\n\r\nFor now, we\'ll leave the server-side programming on pause, so let\'s jump ahead a few steps. Let\'s pretend we\'ve sent the x- and y-coordinates to the server, and the server has come back with a \"correct answer\" response. We can set up our functions for when that happens.\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">function endTimer(){\r\n   var endingTime = Date.now();\r\n   var totalTime = endingTime - startTimer;\r\n}</span></pre>\r\n\r\nWhen the server responds that the user has the correct answer, the first thing we need to do is stop the timer. This function gives us a variable that contains the total number of milliseconds it took the player to find Waldo. This doesn\'t mean much to our user, however, so now we need to make it readable. This will be our longest piece of javascript code yet, but it\'ll all make sense when we break it down:\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">function convertToReadableTime(millis){\r\n   var timeArray = [];\r\n\r\n   var hundredths = findHundredths(millis);\r\n\r\n   var x = Math.floor(millis / 1000);\r\n   var seconds = Math.floor(x % 60);\r\n   x /= 60;\r\n   var minutes = Math.floor(x % 60);\r\n   x /= 60;\r\n   var hours = Math.floor(x % 24);\r\n   x /= 24;\r\n   var days = Math.floor(x);\r\n\r\n   timeArray.push(hundredths, seconds, minutes, hours, days);\r\n\r\n   var timeString = timeFormat(timeArray, 2);\r\n   return timeString;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction findHundredths(millis){\r\n   var secondsDecimal = millis / 1000;\r\n   var x = String(secondsDecimal);\r\n   var splitHundredths = x.split(\".\");\r\n   var bajillionHundredths = splitHundredths[1];\r\n   var newHundredths = bajillionHundredths.charAt(0) + bajillionHundredths.charAt(1);\r\n   return newHundredths;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction timeFormat(array, targetLength){\r\n\r\n   var formattedArray = [];\r\n\r\n   for(var i = 0; i < array.length; i++){\r\n      var output = array[i] + \'\';\r\n\r\n      while (output.length < targetLength) {\r\n         output = \'0\' + output;\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      formattedArray.push(output);\r\n   }\r\n   var finalTimeString = stringItTogether(formattedArray);\r\n   return finalTimeString;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction stringItTogether(arrayOfTimes){\r\n   var stringy = arrayOfTimes[4] + \":\" + arrayOfTimes[3] + \":\" + arrayOfTimes[2] + \":\" + arrayOfTimes[1] + \".\" + arrayOfTimes[0]\r\n   return stringy;\r\n}</span></pre>\r\n\r\nLet\'s start with the first function. This function takes in our milliseconds, here called \"millis\", and will break them down into the number of seconds, minutes, hours, and days. Finding hundredths of a second is a little more complicated, so we need another function for that. We\'re setting our variable \"x\" equal to our total milliseconds divided by 1000. To find the number of seconds, we use Math.floor, which will round down to the nearest whole number, instead of getting back something like 14.333333356498275492. We would just want the \"14\" out of that number.\r\n\r\nWe also use the \"%\" here instead of \"/\". This is called the modulo symbol, and this symbol gives us the remainder, instead of the division. For example, \"5/2\" will give us 2.5, whereas \"5%2\" will give us 1, because 1 is the remainder.\r\n\r\nWe then divide x by 60, and find the minutes by getting the remainder of \"x % 60\". We continue like this to get our hours and days. Now let\'s talk about the hundredths function.\r\n\r\nIn order to find the hundreths of a second that are on the timer, we have to do a little more math. We\'ll do this in the findHundredths function. After dividing the milliseconds by 1000, the decimal point is in the correct spot, i.e. \"30.456\". All we need to do is convert this to a string, then split that string by the decimal point. This will give us an array of [\"30\", \"456\"]. We need the first two numbers from the second string (this is the charAt line of code), and now we have the hundredth of a second!\r\n\r\nFinally, we push our hundredths, seconds, minutes, hours, and days into an array. Here\'s where we call our \"timeFormat\" function. Notice that the numbers we currently have are the lowest number of digits possible. As humans, we like to read time in double digits. 4 hours are typically read as \"04 hours\", like on a digital clock. This function will convert all of our numbers into double digits.\r\n\r\n<h4>Example: 3 minutes, 6 seconds, and 45 hundredths of a second would come in to the function as [45, 6, 3, 0, 0], and becomes [\"45\", \"06\", \"03\", \"00\", \"00\"] after the function has executed.</h4>\r\n\r\nNow, when we call the \"stringItTogether\" function, it will use the numbers in the array to a string that is readable to our user!\r\n\r\n<h4>Another example: 0 days, 4 hours, 37 minutes, 2 seconds, and 56 hundredths of a second will come out as \"00:04:37:02.56\".</h4>\r\n\r\nNow that we have our timer string, we can use it to fill in our modal!\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">function fillModal(timerString){\r\n   var modalTimerText = document.getElementById(\"modalTimer\");\r\n   modalTimerText.innerHTML = timerString;\r\n   displayModal();\r\n}</span></pre>\r\n\r\nIf you take a quick look back in our HTML, we set ourselves up for success by creating that modal content block. Within that tag, we also have a \"modalTimer\" tag, which we can use to input our timer string, and our modal will do all the heavy lifting for us. So, all we need to do is target that tag, as we do in line 2, then fill the innerHTML with that high score string. Our CSS will style the font, size, color, etc. the way we want, and we can move on to displaying the modal.\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">function displayModal(){\r\n   var modal = document.getElementById(\"modal\");\r\n   var modalContent = document.getElementById(\"modalContent\");\r\n   var modalHighScores = document.getElementById(\"modalHighScores\");\r\n   modal.style.display = \"block\";\r\n   modalContent.style.display = \"block\";\r\n}</span></pre>\r\n\r\nWhen we look back in our HTML again, we\'ll see that the display of the modal blocks have been set to \"none\" as default.

(86,1,"2017-10-27 14:11:04","2017-10-27 14:11:04","<h2>Taking Action with Javascript</h2>\r\n\r\nJavascript is the language we use to make our websites dynamic and interactive. It\'s quite a bit more complicated than the previous areas of code, so we\'ll take it slow and break it down into bite-size pieces.\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">window.addEventListener(\'load\', function(){\r\n  \r\n});</span></pre>\r\n\r\nThe first step is to put all of our javascript code into this function. All lines of code from here on will be between these brackets. This line of code executes everything inside of it <strong>after</strong> the page has loaded. This will be important because as soon as the user reaches this page, we will be starting a timer that will measure how long it takes for them to find Waldo. We want the timer to start as soon as the image is loaded, not before, so it is important that we keep everything inside this function.\r\n\r\nNow we need to make a plan of goals that we want to accomplish with our javascript. What is it that we need to do in order to make our game work correctly? I find it helpful to make a list of all the things I need to do:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>We will need to set up a server containing the range of x- and y-coordinates that will register as correct if the user clicks within that range. This will need to be set up in Ruby, so we will do this after we finish the javascript.</li>\r\n 	<li>Start a timer on loading the page.</li>\r\n 	<li>When the user clicks on the image, find the x- and y-coordinates of where they clicked.</li>\r\n 	<li>Send the x- and y-coordinates to the server and let it decide whether they are within the correct range.</li>\r\n 	<li>Trigger the modal to become visible when the user finds Waldo.</li>\r\n 	<li>End the timer when the user finds Waldo.</li>\r\n 	<li>Convert the amount of time passed into a readable format so the user can see how much time it took to find Waldo.</li>\r\n 	<li>Fill the modal with the user\'s time.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nLet\'s start with something easy: starting the timer. In order to start the timer, all we need is one line:\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">var startTimer = Date.now();</span></pre>\r\n\r\nThis line will give us the number of milliseconds that have passed since 1/1/1970. How does that help us? Well, when the user finds Waldo and clicks on him, we\'ll mark the number of milliseconds that have passed again, and subtract the original amount. This will give us the number of milliseconds that have passed since the timer started, which is all we need to know!\r\n\r\nNow let\'s get the x- and y-coordinates of where the user clicked:\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">function getXY(e){\r\n   var xPosition = e.offsetX;\r\n   var yPosition = e.offsetY;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar picClick = document.getElementById(\"WaldoLevel1\");\r\npicClick.addEventListener(\'click\', getXY);</span></pre>\r\n\r\nNow is a good time to discuss event listeners. Whenever a user does anything, from clicking, to holding down the arrow keys, even moving the mouse, is an event. Therefore, we need to add what are called Event Listeners. Think of these as little ears that are listening for a specific event. They do nothing until the event happens, and when the event happens, they will perform a particular action.\r\n\r\nLines 5 and 6 above set up an event listener for when the user clicks on the image. When they do, the program will run the \"getXY\" function, giving us the x- and y-coordinates of where they clicked.\r\n\r\nNote that we use \"e\" here as a representative for the \"event\". In this snippet of code, \"e.offsetX\" is a pre-programmed variable within JavaScript that represents the x-coordinate of the element the user clicked on. This is important, because we don\'t want the x-coordinate of where they clicked on the screen, but rather where they clicked on the image.\r\n\r\nFor now, we\'ll leave the server-side programming on pause, so let\'s jump ahead a few steps. Let\'s pretend we\'ve sent the x- and y-coordinates to the server, and the server has come back with a \"correct answer\" response. We can set up our functions for when that happens.\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">function endTimer(){\r\n   var endingTime = Date.now();\r\n   var totalTime = endingTime - startTimer;\r\n}</span></pre>\r\n\r\nWhen the server responds that the user has the correct answer, the first thing we need to do is stop the timer. This function gives us a variable that contains the total number of milliseconds it took the player to find Waldo. This doesn\'t mean much to our user, however, so now we need to make it readable. This will be our longest piece of javascript code yet, but it\'ll all make sense when we break it down:\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">function convertToReadableTime(millis){\r\n   var timeArray = [];\r\n\r\n   var hundredths = findHundredths(millis);\r\n\r\n   var x = Math.floor(millis / 1000);\r\n   var seconds = Math.floor(x % 60);\r\n   x /= 60;\r\n   var minutes = Math.floor(x % 60);\r\n   x /= 60;\r\n   var hours = Math.floor(x % 24);\r\n   x /= 24;\r\n   var days = Math.floor(x);\r\n\r\n   timeArray.push(hundredths, seconds, minutes, hours, days);\r\n\r\n   var timeString = timeFormat(timeArray, 2);\r\n   return timeString;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction findHundredths(millis){\r\n   var secondsDecimal = millis / 1000;\r\n   var x = String(secondsDecimal);\r\n   var splitHundredths = x.split(\".\");\r\n   var bajillionHundredths = splitHundredths[1];\r\n   var newHundredths = bajillionHundredths.charAt(0) + bajillionHundredths.charAt(1);\r\n   return newHundredths;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction timeFormat(array, targetLength){\r\n\r\n   var formattedArray = [];\r\n\r\n   for(var i = 0; i < array.length; i++){\r\n      var output = array[i] + \'\';\r\n\r\n      while (output.length < targetLength) {\r\n         output = \'0\' + output;\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      formattedArray.push(output);\r\n   }\r\n   var finalTimeString = stringItTogether(formattedArray);\r\n   return finalTimeString;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction stringItTogether(arrayOfTimes){\r\n   var stringy = arrayOfTimes[4] + \":\" + arrayOfTimes[3] + \":\" + arrayOfTimes[2] + \":\" + arrayOfTimes[1] + \".\" + arrayOfTimes[0]\r\n   return stringy;\r\n}</span></pre>\r\n\r\nLet\'s start with the first function. This function takes in our milliseconds, here called \"millis\", and will break them down into the number of seconds, minutes, hours, and days. Finding hundredths of a second is a little more complicated, so we need another function for that. We\'re setting our variable \"x\" equal to our total milliseconds divided by 1000. To find the number of seconds, we use Math.floor, which will round down to the nearest whole number, instead of getting back something like 14.333333356498275492. We would just want the \"14\" out of that number.\r\n\r\nWe also use the \"%\" here instead of \"/\". This is called the modulo symbol, and this symbol gives us the remainder, instead of the division. For example, \"5/2\" will give us 2.5, whereas \"5%2\" will give us 1, because 1 is the remainder.\r\n\r\nWe then divide x by 60, and find the minutes by getting the remainder of \"x % 60\". We continue like this to get our hours and days. Now let\'s talk about the hundredths function.\r\n\r\nIn order to find the hundreths of a second that are on the timer, we have to do a little more math. We\'ll do this in the findHundredths function. After dividing the milliseconds by 1000, the decimal point is in the correct spot, i.e. \"30.456\". All we need to do is convert this to a string, then split that string by the decimal point. This will give us an array of [\"30\", \"456\"]. We need the first two numbers from the second string (this is the charAt line of code), and now we have the hundredth of a second!\r\n\r\nFinally, we push our hundredths, seconds, minutes, hours, and days into an array. Here\'s where we call our \"timeFormat\" function. Notice that the numbers we currently have are the lowest number of digits possible. As humans, we like to read time in double digits. 4 hours are typically read as \"04 hours\", like on a digital clock. This function will convert all of our numbers into double digits.\r\n\r\n<h4>Example: 3 minutes, 6 seconds, and 45 hundredths of a second would come in to the function as [45, 6, 3, 0, 0], and becomes [\"45\", \"06\", \"03\", \"00\", \"00\"] after the function has executed.</h4>\r\n\r\nNow, when we call the \"stringItTogether\" function, it will use the numbers in the array to a string that is readable to our user!\r\n\r\n<h4>Another example: 0 days, 4 hours, 37 minutes, 2 seconds, and 56 hundredths of a second will come out as \"00:04:37:02.56\".</h4>\r\n\r\nNow that we have our timer string, we can use it to fill in our modal!\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">function fillModal(timerString){\r\n   var modalTimerText = document.getElementById(\"modalTimer\");\r\n   modalTimerText.innerHTML = timerString;\r\n   displayModal();\r\n}</span></pre>\r\n\r\nIf you take a quick look back in our HTML, we set ourselves up for success by creating that modal content block. Within that tag, we also have a \"modalTimer\" tag, which we can use to input our timer string, and our modal will do all the heavy lifting for us. So, all we need to do is target that tag, as we do in line 2, then fill the innerHTML with that high score string. Our CSS will style the font, size, color, etc. the way we want, and we can move on to displaying the modal.\r\n\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">function displayModal(){\r\n   var modal = document.getElementById(\"modal\");\r\n   var modalContent = document.getElementById(\"modalContent\");\r\n   var modalHighScores = document.getElementById(\"modalHighScores\");\r\n   modal.style.display = \"block\";\r\n   modalContent.style.display = \"block\";\r\n}</span></pre>\r\n\r\nWhen we look back in our HTML again, we\'ll see that the display of the modal blocks have been set to \"none\" as default. All we need to do to make our modal \"appear\", is to set the display to \"block\". This will place our modal over top of our page, (Note the style \"z-index\" in the CSS style sheet, which indicates the order from front to back of each tag.), and make it visible for the user to interact with.\r\n\r\nNow let\'s have some fun with server-side code!","Where\'s Waldo? - Part Two","","inherit","closed","closed","","50-revision-v1","","","2017-10-27 14:11:04","2017-10-27 14:11:04","",50,"http://evingrost.dev/50-revision-v1/",0,"revision","",0),

We\'ll use our server to verify if the correct coordinates were clicked, then give feedback to the user once they\'ve found Waldo and won the game. Let\'s get started.\n<h2>A Coordinated Effort</h2>\nAs of now, we have no way of verifying whether the x- and y-coordinates that are sent to the server are correct. In order to solve this issue, we\'ll need to write a simple function in Ruby. We\'ll want to create a new ruby file within our general \"Waldo\" folder, and name it what you\'d like. Here, I call mine \"rubyFunctions.rb\".\n\nAfter we\'ve made our file, we need to find out the range of x- and y-coordinates that are acceptable for the user to click on to be considered a \"hit\" for Waldo. This can be done in many ways. There are websites that will show you the x- and y-coordinates of where you click on an uploaded image, or you can simply <span class=\"inline__code\">console.log(e.offsetX + \",\" + e.offsetY);</span> and click on the corners of Waldo to find the range of acceptable coordinates. In the case of this image, the range of acceptable x-coordinates are 380 - 419, and y-coordinates are 262-302.\n\nNow that we know the acceptable coordinate range, we can build our validation function in ruby. In your \"rubyFunctions.rb\" file, enter the following code:\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">def validateXY(x, y)\n   intX = x.to_i\n   intY = y.to_i\n   if (intX &gt; 380) &amp;&amp; (intX &lt; 419) &amp;&amp; (intY &gt; 262) &amp;&amp; (intY &lt; 302)\n      return true\n   else\n      return false\n   end\nend</span></pre>\n&nbsp;\n\nThis simply means that if the coordinates received are within the correct range, return \"true\". If not, return \"false\". Nice and simple!\n\nHowever, we\'re not done with this step yet. We\'ve set up a validation function, but how do we actually pass our x- and y-coordinates into that function and get the answer back? Let\'s start with the JavaScript.\n\nEarlier, we talked about how to get the x- and y-coordinates in JavaScript, but we skipped ahead before sending them to the server. In our JS file, we\'ll need to modify our \"getXY\" function in order to call a new \"sendInfoToServer\" function. I\'ve commented the next bit of code line-by-line as it gets a bit complicated:\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">// This function gets the X and Y coordinates of where the\n<span// user clicked, relative to the image.\n   function getXY(e){\n      var xPosition = e.offsetX;\n      var yPosition = e.offsetY;\n      // Sending x and y to the server.\n      sendInfoToServer(xPosition, yPosition);\n   }\n\n// Takes the x and y coordinates, passed from the getXY\n// function, and sends them to the server to determine whether\n// or not these coordinates are correct for Waldo.\nfunction sendInfoToServer(x, y){\n   // Making a new request.\n   var xyRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();\n   // This line passes our x and y coordinates into a query\n   // string that Sinatra can use and determine what to do with.\n   xyRequest.open(\'GET\', \'http://localhost:4567/puzzle01validate?xPos=\' + x + \'&amp;yPos=\' + y);\n   // The \"onload\" function executes when the server responds that\n   // it received the request. It does what it is instructed to do\n   // with those coordinates.\n   // Example: If a user clicks \"like\" on a facebook post, when\n   // the server responds that it received the request, it will\n   // update the number of likes on that post.\n   xyRequest.onload = saveScore;\n   //This line sends our request.\n   xyRequest.send();\n}</span></pre>\n&nbsp;\n\nXMLHttpRequest is a function that is built into JS, which allows us to send and recieve information to and from a server. For an in-depth tutorial on how this works, check out <a href=\"https://youtu.be/rJesac0_Ftw\" target=\"_blank\">this video</a>. For now, all we need to know is that we are sending our coordinates to our Sinatra controller through something called a query string. A query string comes through to the server like this: <span class=\"inline__code\">http://localhost:4567/puzzle01validate?xPos=394&amp;yPos=280</span>.\n\nNow, when our server receives this query string, it will let us know whether the coordinates are \"true\", within the correct range, or \"false\", not within the correct range.\n\nAs of now, you technically have a working game of Where\'s Waldo! The problem is, there is no visual confirmation that the user got it right when they click on Waldo. The final touch will be in our JavaScript file.\n\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">function saveScore(e){\n   var response = false;\n  \n   if (e.target.responseText === \"true\"){\n      response = true;\n   }\n  \n   // This if statement checks to see if \"didYouFindWaldo\"\n   // returns true. If so, we move on to stop the timer.\n   if (response === true){\n      timerData = endTimer();\n   }\n}</pre></span>\n\nNow, when the server sends back that the coordinates are true, our JavaScript will fill the modal with the user\'s time, and they\'ll win the game!\n\nThere are so many things you can do with this game to turn it into a polished, multi-page game that your friends and family can play. Try adding new pages, buttons to go to the next or previous page, and if you\'re really ambitious, try adding a high-score tracker!

We\'ll use our server to verify if the correct coordinates were clicked, then give feedback to the user once they\'ve found Waldo and won the game. Let\'s get started.\r\n<h2>A Coordinated Effort</h2>\r\nAs of now, we have no way of verifying whether the x- and y-coordinates that are sent to the server are correct. In order to solve this issue, we\'ll need to write a simple function in Ruby. We\'ll want to create a new ruby file within our general \"Waldo\" folder, and name it what you\'d like. Here, I call mine \"rubyFunctions.rb\".\r\n\r\nAfter we\'ve made our file, we need to find out the range of x- and y-coordinates that are acceptable for the user to click on to be considered a \"hit\" for Waldo. This can be done in many ways. There are websites that will show you the x- and y-coordinates of where you click on an uploaded image, or you can simply <span class=\"inline__code\">console.log(e.offsetX + \",\" + e.offsetY);</span> and click on the corners of Waldo to find the range of acceptable coordinates. In the case of this image, the range of acceptable x-coordinates are 380 - 419, and y-coordinates are 262-302.\r\n\r\nNow that we know the acceptable coordinate range, we can build our validation function in ruby. In your \"rubyFunctions.rb\" file, enter the following code:\r\n<pre><span class=\"code__block\">def validateXY(x, y)\r\n   intX = x.to_i\r\n   intY = y.to_i\r\n   if (intX &gt; 380) &amp;&amp; (intX &lt; 419) &amp;&amp; (intY &gt; 262) &amp;&amp; (intY &lt; 302)\r\n      return true\r\n   else\r\n      return false\r\n   end\r\nend</span></pre>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis simply means that if the coordinates received are within the correct range, return \"true\". If not, return \"false\". Nice and simple!\r\n\r\nHowever, we\'re not done with this step yet. We\'ve set up a validation function, but how do we actually pass our x- and y-coordinates into that function and get the answer back?

Having a vast arsenal of tricks and approaches to get you motivated will help.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-110\" src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dictator.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" />\r\n<h2>Be your own dictator.</h2>\r\nAfter a year and a half of being on the <a href=\"https://www.ruled.me/guide-keto-diet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ketogenic diet</a>, I fell off the bandwagon this year when fall came around. The smell of spiced apple cider, the rich orange color of butternut squash soup, pumpkin scented candles and hot apple pie were just too much for me to turn down. After a month of eating all of my favorite fall foods, I knew I needed to get back to taking care of my body, but finding the motivation to get back on track was really tough. One night, I found myself reaching for the caramel apple slices, when my own voice in my head bellowed a loud and firm, \"<strong>NO.</strong>\" I stopped for a moment and stared at the creamy caramel like a puppy whining for table scraps, but the disciplinarian side of me held steadfast. There was no reasoning, no questioning, no second-guessing. In that moment, I had to tell myself <strong>no</strong>, and there was no way out of it.\r\n\r\nIn these moments, I conjure up images of my mother telling me no when I was a child. I would always ask her, \"but why,\" and the answer was always the same: <em>because I said so</em>. Sometimes this is exactly the approach you need to take toward completing a particular goal. Can I just play my game for 5 more minutes? No. Can I just finish up this front-end animation that I\'m having fun with first? No. Can I just finish replying to this tweet before I finish my paper? <strong>No.</strong>\r\n\r\nThis approach is one of the most effective for me in the short-term, but it isn\'t for everyone. Being your own dictator takes a lot of self-discipline, especially in the moment, but there are many other ways to tackle getting motivated.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-112\" src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/desserts.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r\n<h2>Set up a rewards system.</h2>\r\nIf you\'ve ever owned a pet, you\'ll know that animals will do just about anything for a treat. My cat knows \"sit\", \"lay down\", and \"out\" better than a lot of people\'s dogs. She\'ll do anything for a tuna snack. <strong>Anything.</strong>\r\n\r\nReward systems are one of the most basic psychological motivators among all living things. If I told you that I\'d give you one million dollars if you clean your room right now, I imagine you\'d probably do it. While that\'s a cartoonish example, it goes to show that we are motivated for treats or rewards the same as our dogs and cats. With that in mind, you can set yourself up for success by creating your own reward system.\r\n\r\nMost people who use this approach will set food as the reward (my all-time favorite are those marshmallow Pinwheel cookies that are probably 1000 calories each), but I would encourage you to get creative. Maybe there\'s a band coming to town that you\'ve always wanted to see. Maybe you love going out to happy hour with your friends on Friday evenings after work. My ultimate reward is getting to go out to karaoke night with all of my best friends. No matter what the reward, the concept is simple: if I accomplish my goal, I get the reward.\r\n\r\nOf course, you need to hold fast to the rules on this one. If you didn\'t accomplish the goal, you cannot have the reward. No ifs, ands, or buts.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-113\" src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/schedule.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"691\" />\r\n<h2>Be a slave to the schedule.</h2>\r\nOften times when I\'m feeling under-motivated to finish a tedious task, I\'m looking for someone to blame; somewhere to direct my frustration. Keeping a schedule can fulfill that need while helping you to not waste time in the process. Allowing yourself to be a slave to your schedule can help get things done on time and with no excuses. Your best friend calls to ask you out to tea? Sorry, I can\'t. The schedule says I need to be cleaning the house.\r\n\r\nHaving a hand-written schedule can make a big difference. If I grab a pen and actually write down my schedule in a book, it helps me to remember it\'s there, and gives an unconscious sense of authority. That doesn\'t mean we can\'t also have a digital schedule on top of that. Google Calendar keeps me on track for more long-term projects, <a href=\"https://trello.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trello</a> helps me with my web development or work-related projects, and the alarm on my phone rules my everyday life.\r\n\r\nIf you think it\'s possible you\'re going to slip up, you can set witty alarms to nag you into doing what you need to do. If I\'m supposed to be cleaning the kitchen at 11:00, I\'ll set an alarm at 11:05 that says \"You better be cleaning the kitchen.\" At 11:10, \"Seriously, stop messing around and get to cleaning.\" 11:15 - \"I\'m not going to stop nagging you until you get this done.\" 11:18 - \"It\'s only going to get worse from here.\" Once I\'ve started my task, I get to disable all other alarms, and my phone leaves me alone. I have no choice, I\'m a slave to the schedule.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-114\" src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/autopilot.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"691\" />\r\n<h2>Set yourself to auto-pilot.</h2>\r\nWe don\'t give enough credit to the amazing phenomenon of muscle memory. For most of us, when we wake up early in the morning to get ready for school or work, we\'re essentially on auto-pilot. We aren\'t really thinking; our muscles just know what to do and how to get ready the same as every other day. Have you ever moved to a new home, then jumped in your car after work and driven to your old house without thinking? These patterns and routines that our unconscious mind stores can be used to our advantage.\r\n\r\nYesterday, I came home from a long day\'s work wanting to sit on the couch and relax, but Wednesdays are yoga night, and I have to go. The last thing I wanted to do was go out in the snow, drive to the gym, and exhaust my body. I cooked one of my favorite meals, ate slowly, stared off into space then started my \"to the gym\" routine. Like a zombie, I switched off my brain and went into my room to change into my gym clothes. The next thing I knew, I was in my car and on my way to the gym. My muscles know exactly how this routine goes without any input from my conscious brain. Once I\'m at the gym, I\'m not going to all that trouble just to turn around and go straight home. I cruise-control walk into class, lay out my mat, and sit down. Mission accomplished.\r\n<h2>Enlist help.</h2>\r\nHaving a partner in life can make reaching goals a lot easier, but this is an approach that you can do with friends or family members as well. I can\'t tell you how many times I\'ve said, \"Hey honey, if you see me playing Might and Magic 7 tonight, could you ask me if I\'ve finished that feature for my website before I continue playing?\"\r\n\r\nWe often gauge what\'s acceptable for us by what others say and do, especially people we trust. If your wife is on Facebook and beckons you to come over to look at this post, you\'ll be much more likely to get distracted and waste time. She\'s looking at Facebook, why shouldn\'t I? If you come to your best friend\'s party and they confront you with, \"I thought you had that really important paper to write. Have you finished it,\" you\'ll probably leave early and go back to writing that paper.\r\n\r\nYou can enlist help from others to help keep you on track with an important goal. Moms are another great resource for this tactic. Every conversation with my mom on the phone is an inevitable checklist of all the things I was supposed to get done that week and what I should do next week. While it can feel nagging, I find myself getting things done just so I don\'t have to listen to her disappointment over the phone the next week, and that\'s a good thing.\r\n\r\nThere is one important warning that comes with this approach: be careful not to lash out at those you\'ve asked to help. If I tell my fiancee I\'m on a strict diet and he needs to help me stay on it, I cannot be angry when he says, \"Aren\'t you on a diet? You shouldn\'t be eating that.\" That goes for your mom, your friends, your boss, or your partner, no matter what the subject. When you ask for help staying on track, you\'ve got to mean it.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-115\" src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/music.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"691\" />\r\n<h2>Let music set the pace.</h2>\r\nMusic is one of the greatest mood-setters in existence. On days when I\'m frustrated or tired, I can put on some silly J-pop or parody songs and it\'ll put a smile on my face every time. You can put on <a href=\"https://youtu.be/qn7HvnMJZd4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fast-paced hard rock</a> to get you pumped up, or <a href=\"https://youtu.be/e9GtPX6c_kg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">something calmer</a> to bring you down to something quieter like writing a paper. In moments of motivational desperation, I always have one song that forces me to get up and make a true change. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/hRVOOwFNp5U\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Here it is</a> (WARNING: profane, graphic, adult content), what\'s yours?\r\n\r\nWhatever your musical muse may be, it\'s helpful to set up playlists for different moods that you\'d like to set. Don\'t be afraid to put on some headphones, close your eyes, take some time to reset your mood, and let the music guide you.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-116\" src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/guilty.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"691\" />\r\n<h2>Don\'t give in to guilt.</h2>\r\nHow many times has this happened to you or someone you know: You go to a grocery store and stuff your cart full of every organic vegetable, grass-fed meat, and nutritious \"superfood\" you can find. You\'ve decided to start on a new healthy eating plan and you\'re jumping in head-first. You\'re off to a good start. Three days later, it\'s your best friend\'s birthday party; you give in to temptation and take a cookie or a slice of cake. Everything is ruined. You couldn\'t even make it four days, what were you thinking? Well, you might as well just eat 4 cookies, another slice of cake, and 2 ropes of licorice, because you\'ve ruined the diet anyway, what does it matter now?\r\n\r\nThat\'s guilt talking. We\'re all human; we have needs, desires, and momentary lapses in judgement where we make mistakes. The first thing to keep in mind is that feeling guilty about a mistake can lead to very destructive behavior. You ate a cookie. So what? It was good, enjoy it. Now, you\'ve had your fun and it\'s time to recommit to that healthy eating lifestyle. Maybe you had set a goal to fix that bug last night, but instead you binge watched Stranger Things 2 until 1 AM. It\'s okay. Forgive yourself, then recommit and set a new goal in the morning.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNo matter what your approach to getting motivated, the most important piece is always to stay focused on the goal. Whether big or small, it feels great to accomplish the goals we set for ourselves and make our lives better in the process. Take the time to write down a few goals that you would like to accomplish this week, month, or year, and really focus on accomplishing them. You\'ll feel great about yourself, raise your confidence, and improve your life in the process.

Having a vast arsenal of tricks and approaches to get you motivated will help.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Be your own dictator.</h2>\r\nAfter a year and a half of being on the <a href=\"https://www.ruled.me/guide-keto-diet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ketogenic diet</a>, I fell off the bandwagon this year when fall came around. The smell of spiced apple cider, the rich orange color of butternut squash soup, pumpkin scented candles and hot apple pie were just too much for me to turn down. After a month of eating all of my favorite fall foods, I knew I needed to get back to taking care of my body, but finding the motivation to get back on track was really tough. One night, I found myself reaching for the caramel apple slices, when my own voice in my head bellowed a loud and firm, \"<strong>NO.</strong>\" I stopped for a moment and stared at the creamy caramel like a puppy whining for table scraps, but the disciplinarian side of me held steadfast. There was no reasoning, no questioning, no second-guessing. In that moment, I had to tell myself <strong>no</strong>, and there was no way out of it.\r\n\r\nIn these moments, I conjure up images of my mother telling me no when I was a child. I would always ask her, \"but why,\" and the answer was always the same: <em>because I said so</em>. Sometimes this is exactly the approach you need to take toward completing a particular goal. Can I just play my game for 5 more minutes? No. Can I just finish up this front-end animation that I\'m having fun with first? No. Can I just finish replying to this tweet before I finish my paper? <strong>No.</strong>\r\n\r\nThis approach is one of the most effective for me in the short-term, but it isn\'t for everyone. Being your own dictator takes a lot of self-discipline, especially in the moment, but there are many other ways to tackle getting motivated.\r\n<h2>Set up a rewards system.</h2>\r\nIf you\'ve ever owned a pet, you\'ll know that animals will do just about anything for a treat. My cat knows \"sit\", \"lay down\", and \"out\" better than a lot of people\'s dogs. She\'ll do anything for a tuna snack. <strong>Anything.</strong>\r\n\r\nReward systems are one of the most basic psychological motivators among all living things. If I told you that I\'d give you one million dollars if you clean your room right now, I imagine you\'d probably do it. While that\'s a cartoonish example, it goes to show that we are motivated for treats or rewards the same as our dogs and cats. With that in mind, you can set yourself up for success by creating your own reward system.\r\n\r\nMost people who use this approach will set food as the reward (my all-time favorite are those marshmallow Pinwheel cookies that are probably 1000 calories each), but I would encourage you to get creative. Maybe there\'s a band coming to town that you\'ve always wanted to see. Maybe you love going out to happy hour with your friends on Friday evenings after work. My ultimate reward is getting to go out to karaoke night with all of my best friends. No matter what the reward, the concept is simple: if I accomplish my goal, I get the reward.\r\n\r\nOf course, you need to hold fast to the rules on this one. If you didn\'t accomplish the goal, you cannot have the reward. No ifs, ands, or buts.\r\n<h2>Be a slave to the schedule.</h2>\r\nOften times when I\'m feeling under-motivated to finish a tedious task, I\'m looking for someone to blame; somewhere to direct my frustration. Keeping a schedule can fulfill that need while helping you to not waste time in the process. Allowing yourself to be a slave to your schedule can help get things done on time and with no excuses. Your best friend calls to ask you out to tea? Sorry, I can\'t. The schedule says I need to be cleaning the house.\r\n\r\nHaving a hand-written schedule can make a big difference. If I grab a pen and actually write down my schedule in a book, it helps me to remember it\'s there, and gives an unconscious sense of authority. That doesn\'t mean we can\'t also have a digital schedule on top of that. Google Calendar keeps me on track for more long-term projects, <a href=\"https://trello.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trello</a> helps me with my web development or work-related projects, and the alarm on my phone rules my everyday life.\r\n\r\nIf you think it\'s possible you\'re going to slip up, you can set witty alarms to nag you into doing what you need to do. If I\'m supposed to be cleaning the kitchen at 11:00, I\'ll set an alarm at 11:05 that says \"You better be cleaning the kitchen.\" At 11:10, \"Seriously, stop messing around and get to cleaning.\" 11:15 - \"I\'m not going to stop nagging you until you get this done.\" 11:18 - \"It\'s only going to get worse from here.\" Once I\'ve started my task, I get to disable all other alarms, and my phone leaves me alone. I have no choice, I\'m a slave to the schedule.\r\n<h2>Set yourself to auto-pilot.</h2>\r\nWe don\'t give enough credit to the amazing phenomenon of muscle memory. For most of us, when we wake up early in the morning to get ready for school or work, we\'re essentially on auto-pilot. We aren\'t really thinking; our muscles just know what to do and how to get ready the same as every other day. Have you ever moved to a new home, then jumped in your car after work and driven to your old house without thinking? These patterns and routines that our unconscious mind stores can be used to our advantage.\r\n\r\nYesterday, I came home from a long day\'s work wanting to sit on the couch and relax, but Wednesdays are yoga night, and I have to go.

I can\'t tell you how many times I\'ve said, \"Hey honey, if you see me playing Might and Magic 7 tonight, could you ask me if I\'ve finished that feature for my website before I continue playing?\"\r\n\r\nWe often gauge what\'s acceptable for us by what others say and do, especially people we trust. If your wife is on Facebook and beckons you to come over to look at this post, you\'ll be much more likely to get distracted and waste time. She\'s looking at Facebook, why shouldn\'t I? If you come to your best friend\'s party and they confront you with, \"I thought you had that really important paper to write. Have you finished it,\" you\'ll probably leave early and go back to writing that paper.\r\n\r\nYou can enlist help from others to help keep you on track with an important goal. Moms are another great resource for this tactic. Every conversation with my mom on the phone is an inevitable checklist of all the things I was supposed to get done that week and what I should do next week. While it can feel nagging, I find myself getting things done just so I don\'t have to listen to her disappointment over the phone the next week, and that\'s a good thing.\r\n\r\nThere is one important warning that comes with this approach: be careful not to lash out at those you\'ve asked to help. If I tell my fiancee I\'m on a strict diet and he needs to help me stay on it, I cannot be angry when he says, \"Aren\'t you on a diet? You shouldn\'t be eating that.\" That goes for your mom, your friends, your boss, or your partner, no matter what the subject. When you ask for help staying on track, you\'ve got to mean it.\r\n<h2>Let music set the pace.</h2>\r\nMusic is one of the greatest mood-setters in existence. On days when I\'m frustrated or tired, I can put on some silly J-pop or parody songs and it\'ll put a smile on my face every time. You can put on <a href=\"https://youtu.be/qn7HvnMJZd4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fast-paced hard rock</a> to get you pumped up, or <a href=\"https://youtu.be/e9GtPX6c_kg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">something calmer</a> to bring you down to something quieter like writing a paper. In moments of motivational desperation, I always have one song that forces me to get up and make a true change. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/hRVOOwFNp5U\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Here it is</a> (WARNING: profane, graphic, adult content), what\'s yours?\r\n\r\nWhatever your musical muse may be, it\'s helpful to set up playlists for different moods that you\'d like to set. Don\'t be afraid to put on some headphones, close your eyes, take some time to reset your mood, and let the music guide you.\r\n<h2>Don\'t give in to guilt.</h2>\r\nHow many times has this happened to you or someone you know: You go to a grocery store and stuff your cart full of every organic vegetable, grass-fed meat, and nutritious \"superfood\" you can find. You\'ve decided to start on a new healthy eating plan and you\'re jumping in head-first. You\'re off to a good start.

Having a vast arsenal of tricks and approaches to get you motivated will help.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Be your own dictator.</h2>\r\nAfter a year and a half of being on the <a href=\"https://www.ruled.me/guide-keto-diet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ketogenic diet</a>, I fell off the bandwagon this year when fall came around. The smell of spiced apple cider, the rich orange color of butternut squash soup, pumpkin scented candles and hot apple pie were just too much for me to turn down. After a month of eating all of my favorite fall foods, I knew I needed to get back to taking care of my body, but finding the motivation to get back on track was really tough. One night, I found myself reaching for the caramel apple slices, when my own voice in my head bellowed a loud and firm, \"<strong>NO.</strong>\" I stopped for a moment and stared at the creamy caramel like a puppy whining for table scraps, but the disciplinarian side of me held steadfast. There was no reasoning, no questioning, no second-guessing. In that moment, I had to tell myself <strong>no</strong>, and there was no way out of it.\r\n\r\nIn these moments, I conjure up images of my mother telling me no when I was a child. I would always ask her, \"but why,\" and the answer was always the same: <em>because I said so</em>. Sometimes this is exactly the approach you need to take toward completing a particular goal. Can I just play my game for 5 more minutes? No. Can I just finish up this front-end animation that I\'m having fun with first? No. Can I just finish replying to this tweet before I finish my paper? <strong>No.</strong>\r\n\r\nThis approach is one of the most effective for me in the short-term, but it isn\'t for everyone. Being your own dictator takes a lot of self-discipline, especially in the moment, but there are many other ways to tackle getting motivated.\r\n<h2>Set up a rewards system.</h2>\r\nIf you\'ve ever owned a pet, you\'ll know that animals will do just about anything for a treat. My cat knows \"sit\", \"lay down\", and \"out\" better than a lot of people\'s dogs. She\'ll do anything for a tuna snack. <strong>Anything.</strong>\r\n\r\nReward systems are one of the most basic psychological motivators among all living things. If I told you that I\'d give you one million dollars if you clean your room right now, I imagine you\'d probably do it. While that\'s a cartoonish example, it goes to show that we are motivated for treats or rewards the same as our dogs and cats. With that in mind, you can set yourself up for success by creating your own reward system.\r\n\r\nMost people who use this approach will set food as the reward (my all-time favorite are those marshmallow Pinwheel cookies that are probably 1000 calories each), but I would encourage you to get creative. Maybe there\'s a band coming to town that you\'ve always wanted to see. Maybe you love going out to happy hour with your friends on Friday evenings after work. My ultimate reward is getting to go out to karaoke night with all of my best friends. No matter what the reward, the concept is simple: if I accomplish my goal, I get the reward.\r\n\r\nOf course, you need to hold fast to the rules on this one. If you didn\'t accomplish the goal, you cannot have the reward. No ifs, ands, or buts.\r\n<h2>Be a slave to the schedule.</h2>\r\nOften times when I\'m feeling under-motivated to finish a tedious task, I\'m looking for someone to blame; somewhere to direct my frustration. Keeping a schedule can fulfill that need while helping you to not waste time in the process. Allowing yourself to be a slave to your schedule can help get things done on time and with no excuses. Your best friend calls to ask you out to tea? Sorry, I can\'t. The schedule says I need to be cleaning the house.\r\n\r\nHaving a hand-written schedule can make a big difference. If I grab a pen and actually write down my schedule in a book, it helps me to remember it\'s there, and gives an unconscious sense of authority. That doesn\'t mean we can\'t also have a digital schedule on top of that. Google Calendar keeps me on track for more long-term projects, <a href=\"https://trello.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trello</a> helps me with my web development or work-related projects, and the alarm on my phone rules my everyday life.\r\n\r\nIf you think it\'s possible you\'re going to slip up, you can set witty alarms to nag you into doing what you need to do. If I\'m supposed to be cleaning the kitchen at 11:00, I\'ll set an alarm at 11:05 that says \"You better be cleaning the kitchen.\" At 11:10, \"Seriously, stop messing around and get to cleaning.\" 11:15 - \"I\'m not going to stop nagging you until you get this done.\" 11:18 - \"It\'s only going to get worse from here.\" Once I\'ve started my task, I get to disable all other alarms, and my phone leaves me alone. I have no choice, I\'m a slave to the schedule.\r\n<h2>Set yourself to auto-pilot.</h2>\r\nWe don\'t give enough credit to the amazing phenomenon of muscle memory. For most of us, when we wake up early in the morning to get ready for school or work, we\'re essentially on auto-pilot. We aren\'t really thinking; our muscles just know what to do and how to get ready the same as every other day. Have you ever moved to a new home, then jumped in your car after work and driven to your old house without thinking? These patterns and routines that our unconscious mind stores can be used to our advantage.\r\n\r\nYesterday, I came home from a long day\'s work wanting to sit on the couch and relax, but Wednesdays are yoga night, and I have to go. The last thing I wanted to do was go out in the snow, drive to the gym, and exhaust my body. I cooked one of my favorite meals, ate slowly, stared off into space then started my \"to the gym\" routine. Like a zombie, I switched off my brain and went into my room to change into my gym clothes. The next thing I knew, I was in my car and on my way to the gym. My muscles know exactly how this routine goes without any input from my conscious brain. Once I\'m at the gym, I\'m not going to all that trouble just to turn around and go straight home. I cruise-control walk into class, lay out my mat, and sit down. Mission accomplished.\r\n<h2>Enlist help.</h2>\r\nHaving a partner in life can make reaching goals a lot easier, but this is an approach that you can do with friends or family members as well. I can\'t tell you how many times I\'ve said, \"Hey honey, if you see me playing Might and Magic 7 tonight, could you ask me if I\'ve finished that feature for my website before I continue playing?\"\r\n\r\nWe often gauge what\'s acceptable for us by what others say and do, especially people we trust.

If you come to your best friend\'s party and they confront you with, \"I thought you had that really important paper to write.

Having a vast arsenal of tricks and approaches to get you motivated will help.\r\n<h2>Be your own dictator.</h2>\r\nAfter a year and a half of being on the <a href=\"https://www.ruled.me/guide-keto-diet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ketogenic diet</a>, I fell off the bandwagon this year when fall came around. The smell of spiced apple cider, the rich orange color of butternut squash soup, pumpkin scented candles and hot apple pie were just too much for me to turn down. After a month of eating all of my favorite fall foods, I knew I needed to get back to taking care of my body, but finding the motivation to get back on track was really tough. One night, I found myself reaching for the caramel apple slices, when my own voice in my head bellowed a loud and firm, \"<strong>NO.</strong>\" I stopped for a moment and stared at the creamy caramel like a puppy whining for table scraps, but the disciplinarian side of me held steadfast. There was no reasoning, no questioning, no second-guessing. In that moment, I had to tell myself <strong>no</strong>, and there was no way out of it.\r\n\r\nIn these moments, I conjure up images of my mother telling me no when I was a child. I would always ask her, \"but why,\" and the answer was always the same: <em>because I said so</em>. Sometimes this is exactly the approach you need to take toward completing a particular goal. Can I just play my game for 5 more minutes? No. Can I just finish up this front-end animation that I\'m having fun with first? No. Can I just finish replying to this tweet before I finish my paper? <strong>No.</strong>\r\n\r\nThis approach is one of the most effective for me in the short-term, but it isn\'t for everyone. Being your own dictator takes a lot of self-discipline, especially in the moment, but there are many other ways to tackle getting motivated.\r\n<h2>Set up a rewards system.</h2>\r\nIf you\'ve ever owned a pet, you\'ll know that animals will do just about anything for a treat. My cat knows \"sit\", \"lay down\", and \"out\" better than a lot of people\'s dogs. She\'ll do anything for a tuna snack. <strong>Anything.</strong>\r\n\r\nReward systems are one of the most basic psychological motivators among all living things. If I told you that I\'d give you one million dollars if you clean your room right now, I imagine you\'d probably do it. While that\'s a cartoonish example, it goes to show that we are motivated for treats or rewards the same as our dogs and cats. With that in mind, you can set yourself up for success by creating your own reward system.\r\n\r\nMost people who use this approach will set food as the reward (my all-time favorite are those marshmallow Pinwheel cookies that are probably 1000 calories each), but I would encourage you to get creative. Maybe there\'s a band coming to town that you\'ve always wanted to see. Maybe you love going out to happy hour with your friends on Friday evenings after work. My ultimate reward is getting to go out to karaoke night with all of my best friends. No matter what the reward, the concept is simple: if I accomplish my goal, I get the reward.\r\n\r\nOf course, you need to hold fast to the rules on this one. If you didn\'t accomplish the goal, you cannot have the reward. No ifs, ands, or buts.\r\n<h2>Be a slave to the schedule.</h2>\r\nOften times when I\'m feeling under-motivated to finish a tedious task, I\'m looking for someone to blame; somewhere to direct my frustration. Keeping a schedule can fulfill that need while helping you to not waste time in the process. Allowing yourself to be a slave to your schedule can help get things done on time and with no excuses. Your best friend calls to ask you out to tea? Sorry, I can\'t. The schedule says I need to be cleaning the house.\r\n\r\nHaving a hand-written schedule can make a big difference. If I grab a pen and actually write down my schedule in a book, it helps me to remember it\'s there, and gives an unconscious sense of authority. That doesn\'t mean we can\'t also have a digital schedule on top of that. Google Calendar keeps me on track for more long-term projects, <a href=\"https://trello.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trello</a> helps me with my web development or work-related projects, and the alarm on my phone rules my everyday life.\r\n\r\nIf you think it\'s possible you\'re going to slip up, you can set witty alarms to nag you into doing what you need to do. If I\'m supposed to be cleaning the kitchen at 11:00, I\'ll set an alarm at 11:05 that says \"You better be cleaning the kitchen.\" At 11:10, \"Seriously, stop messing around and get to cleaning.\" 11:15 - \"I\'m not going to stop nagging you until you get this done.\" 11:18 - \"It\'s only going to get worse from here.\" Once I\'ve started my task, I get to disable all other alarms, and my phone leaves me alone. I have no choice, I\'m a slave to the schedule.\r\n<h2>Set yourself to auto-pilot.</h2>\r\nWe don\'t give enough credit to the amazing phenomenon of muscle memory. For most of us, when we wake up early in the morning to get ready for school or work, we\'re essentially on auto-pilot. We aren\'t really thinking; our muscles just know what to do and how to get ready the same as every other day. Have you ever moved to a new home, then jumped in your car after work and driven to your old house without thinking? These patterns and routines that our unconscious mind stores can be used to our advantage.\r\n\r\nYesterday, I came home from a long day\'s work wanting to sit on the couch and relax, but Wednesdays are yoga night, and I have to go. The last thing I wanted to do was go out in the snow, drive to the gym, and exhaust my body. I cooked one of my favorite meals, ate slowly, stared off into space then started my \"to the gym\" routine. Like a zombie, I switched off my brain and went into my room to change into my gym clothes. The next thing I knew, I was in my car and on my way to the gym. My muscles know exactly how this routine goes without any input from my conscious brain. Once I\'m at the gym, I\'m not going to all that trouble just to turn around and go straight home. I cruise-control walk into class, lay out my mat, and sit down. Mission accomplished.\r\n<h2>Enlist help.</h2>\r\nHaving a partner in life can make reaching goals a lot easier, but this is an approach that you can do with friends or family members as well. I can\'t tell you how many times I\'ve said, \"Hey honey, if you see me playing Might and Magic 7 tonight, could you ask me if I\'ve finished that feature for my website before I continue playing?\"\r\n\r\nWe often gauge what\'s acceptable for us by what others say and do, especially people we trust. If your wife is on Facebook and beckons you to come over to look at this post, you\'ll be much more likely to get distracted and waste time. She\'s looking at Facebook, why shouldn\'t I? If you come to your best friend\'s party and they confront you with, \"I thought you had that really important paper to write. Have you finished it,\" you\'ll probably leave early and go back to writing that paper.\r\n\r\nYou can enlist help from others to help keep you on track with an important goal. Moms are another great resource for this tactic. Every conversation with my mom on the phone is an inevitable checklist of all the things I was supposed to get done that week and what I should do next week. While it can feel nagging, I find myself getting things done just so I don\'t have to listen to her disappointment over the phone the next week, and that\'s a good thing.\r\n\r\nThere is one important warning that comes with this approach: be careful not to lash out at those you\'ve asked to help. If I tell my fiancee I\'m on a strict diet and he needs to help me stay on it, I cannot be angry when he says, \"Aren\'t you on a diet? You shouldn\'t be eating that.\" That goes for your mom, your friends, your boss, or your partner, no matter what the subject. When you ask for help staying on track, you\'ve got to mean it.\r\n<h2>Let music set the pace.</h2>\r\nMusic is one of the greatest mood-setters in existence. On days when I\'m frustrated or tired, I can put on some silly J-pop or parody songs and it\'ll put a smile on my face every time. You can put on <a href=\"https://youtu.be/qn7HvnMJZd4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fast-paced hard rock</a> to get you pumped up, or <a href=\"https://youtu.be/e9GtPX6c_kg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">something calmer</a> to bring you down to something quieter like writing a paper. In moments of motivational desperation, I always have one song that forces me to get up and make a true change. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/hRVOOwFNp5U\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Here it is</a> (WARNING: profane, graphic, adult content), what\'s yours?\r\n\r\nWhatever your musical muse may be, it\'s helpful to set up playlists for different moods that you\'d like to set. Don\'t be afraid to put on some headphones, close your eyes, take some time to reset your mood, and let the music guide you.\r\n<h2>Don\'t give in to guilt.</h2>\r\nHow many times has this happened to you or someone you know: You go to a grocery store and stuff your cart full of every organic vegetable, grass-fed meat, and nutritious \"superfood\" you can find. You\'ve decided to start on a new healthy eating plan and you\'re jumping in head-first. You\'re off to a good start. Three days later, it\'s your best friend\'s birthday party; you give in to temptation and take a cookie or a slice of cake. Everything is ruined. You couldn\'t even make it four days, what were you thinking? Well, you might as well just eat 4 cookies, another slice of cake, and 2 ropes of licorice, because you\'ve ruined the diet anyway, what does it matter now?\r\n\r\nThat\'s guilt talking. We\'re all human; we have needs, desires, and momentary lapses in judgement where we make mistakes. The first thing to keep in mind is that feeling guilty about a mistake can lead to very destructive behavior. You ate a cookie. So what? It was good, enjoy it. Now, you\'ve had your fun and it\'s time to recommit to that healthy eating lifestyle. Maybe you had set a goal to fix that bug last night, but instead you binge watched Stranger Things 2 until 1 AM. It\'s okay. Forgive yourself, then recommit and set a new goal in the morning.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNo matter what your approach to getting motivated, the most important piece is always to stay focused on the goal. Whether big or small, it feels great to accomplish the goals we set for ourselves and make our lives better in the process. Take the time to write down a few goals that you would like to accomplish this week, month, or year, and really focus on accomplishing them.

With that in mind, you can set yourself up for success by creating your own reward system.\r\n\r\nMost people who use this approach will set food as the reward (my all-time favorite are those marshmallow Pinwheel cookies that are probably 1000 calories each), but I would encourage you to get creative. Maybe there\'s a band coming to town that you\'ve always wanted to see. Maybe you love going out to happy hour with your friends on Friday evenings after work. My ultimate reward is getting to go out to karaoke night with all of my best friends. No matter what the reward, the concept is simple: if I accomplish my goal, I get the reward.\r\n\r\nOf course, you need to hold fast to the rules on this one. If you didn\'t accomplish the goal, you cannot have the reward. No ifs, ands, or buts.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-113\" src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/schedule.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"691\" />\r\n<h2>Be a slave to the schedule.</h2>\r\nOften times when I\'m feeling under-motivated to finish a tedious task, I\'m looking for someone to blame; somewhere to direct my frustration. Keeping a schedule can fulfill that need while helping you to not waste time in the process. Allowing yourself to be a slave to your schedule can help get things done on time and with no excuses. Your best friend calls to ask you out to tea? Sorry, I can\'t. The schedule says I need to be cleaning the house.\r\n\r\nHaving a hand-written schedule can make a big difference. If I grab a pen and actually write down my schedule in a book, it helps me to remember it\'s there, and gives an unconscious sense of authority. That doesn\'t mean we can\'t also have a digital schedule on top of that. Google Calendar keeps me on track for more long-term projects, <a href=\"https://trello.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trello</a> helps me with my web development or work-related projects, and the alarm on my phone rules my everyday life.\r\n\r\nIf you think it\'s possible you\'re going to slip up, you can set witty alarms to nag you into doing what you need to do. If I\'m supposed to be cleaning the kitchen at 11:00, I\'ll set an alarm at 11:05 that says \"You better be cleaning the kitchen.\" At 11:10, \"Seriously, stop messing around and get to cleaning.\" 11:15 - \"I\'m not going to stop nagging you until you get this done.\" 11:18 - \"It\'s only going to get worse from here.\" Once I\'ve started my task, I get to disable all other alarms, and my phone leaves me alone. I have no choice, I\'m a slave to the schedule.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-114\" src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/autopilot.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"691\" />\r\n<h2>Set yourself to auto-pilot.</h2>\r\nWe don\'t give enough credit to the amazing phenomenon of muscle memory. For most of us, when we wake up early in the morning to get ready for school or work, we\'re essentially on auto-pilot. We aren\'t really thinking; our muscles just know what to do and how to get ready the same as every other day. Have you ever moved to a new home, then jumped in your car after work and driven to your old house without thinking? These patterns and routines that our unconscious mind stores can be used to our advantage.\r\n\r\nYesterday, I came home from a long day\'s work wanting to sit on the couch and relax, but Wednesdays are yoga night, and I have to go. The last thing I wanted to do was go out in the snow, drive to the gym, and exhaust my body. I cooked one of my favorite meals, ate slowly, stared off into space then started my \"to the gym\" routine. Like a zombie, I switched off my brain and went into my room to change into my gym clothes. The next thing I knew, I was in my car and on my way to the gym. My muscles know exactly how this routine goes without any input from my conscious brain. Once I\'m at the gym, I\'m not going to all that trouble just to turn around and go straight home. I cruise-control walk into class, lay out my mat, and sit down. Mission accomplished.\r\n<h2>Enlist help.</h2>\r\nHaving a partner in life can make reaching goals a lot easier, but this is an approach that you can do with friends or family members as well. I can\'t tell you how many times I\'ve said, \"Hey honey, if you see me playing Might and Magic 7 tonight, could you ask me if I\'ve finished that feature for my website before I continue playing?\"\r\n\r\nWe often gauge what\'s acceptable for us by what others say and do, especially people we trust. If your wife is on Facebook and beckons you to come over to look at this post, you\'ll be much more likely to get distracted and waste time. She\'s looking at Facebook, why shouldn\'t I? If you come to your best friend\'s party and they confront you with, \"I thought you had that really important paper to write. Have you finished it,\" you\'ll probably leave early and go back to writing that paper.\r\n\r\nYou can enlist help from others to help keep you on track with an important goal. Moms are another great resource for this tactic. Every conversation with my mom on the phone is an inevitable checklist of all the things I was supposed to get done that week and what I should do next week. While it can feel nagging, I find myself getting things done just so I don\'t have to listen to her disappointment over the phone the next week, and that\'s a good thing.\r\n\r\nThere is one important warning that comes with this approach: be careful not to lash out at those you\'ve asked to help. If I tell my fiancee I\'m on a strict diet and he needs to help me stay on it, I cannot be angry when he says, \"Aren\'t you on a diet? You shouldn\'t be eating that.\" That goes for your mom, your friends, your boss, or your partner, no matter what the subject. When you ask for help staying on track, you\'ve got to mean it.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-115\" src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/music.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"691\" />\r\n<h2>Let music set the pace.</h2>\r\nMusic is one of the greatest mood-setters in existence. On days when I\'m frustrated or tired, I can put on some silly J-pop or parody songs and it\'ll put a smile on my face every time. You can put on <a href=\"https://youtu.be/qn7HvnMJZd4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fast-paced hard rock</a> to get you pumped up, or <a href=\"https://youtu.be/e9GtPX6c_kg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">something calmer</a> to bring you down to something quieter like writing a paper. In moments of motivational desperation, I always have one song that forces me to get up and make a true change. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/hRVOOwFNp5U\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Here it is</a> (WARNING: profane, graphic, adult content), what\'s yours?\r\n\r\nWhatever your musical muse may be, it\'s helpful to set up playlists for different moods that you\'d like to set. Don\'t be afraid to put on some headphones, close your eyes, take some time to reset your mood, and let the music guide you.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-116\" src=\"http://evingrost.dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/guilty.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"691\" />\r\n<h2>Don\'t give in to guilt.</h2>\r\nHow many times has this happened to you or someone you know: You go to a grocery store and stuff your cart full of every organic vegetable, grass-fed meat, and nutritious \"superfood\" you can find. You\'ve decided to start on a new healthy eating plan and you\'re jumping in head-first. You\'re off to a good start. Three days later, it\'s your best friend\'s birthday party; you give in to temptation and take a cookie or a slice of cake. Everything is ruined. You couldn\'t even make it four days, what were you thinking? Well, you might as well just eat 4 cookies, another slice of cake, and 2 ropes of licorice, because you\'ve ruined the diet anyway, what does it matter now?\r\n\r\nThat\'s guilt talking. We\'re all human; we have needs, desires, and momentary lapses in judgement where we make mistakes. The first thing to keep in mind is that feeling guilty about a mistake can lead to very destructive behavior. You ate a cookie. So what? It was good, enjoy it. Now, you\'ve had your fun and it\'s time to recommit to that healthy eating lifestyle. Maybe you had set a goal to fix that bug last night, but instead you binge watched Stranger Things 2 until 1 AM. It\'s okay. Forgive yourself, then recommit and set a new goal in the morning.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNo matter what your approach to getting motivated, the most important piece is always to stay focused on the goal. Whether big or small, it feels great to accomplish the goals we set for ourselves and make our lives better in the process. Take the time to write down a few goals that you would like to accomplish this week, month, or year, and really focus on accomplishing them. You\'ll feel great about yourself, raise your confidence, and improve your life in the process.
