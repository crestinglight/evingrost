				<h1>I'm Evin. Designer, Developer, Animator.</h1>

				<p>I am a front-end developer and user interface designer. I love creating sleek, responsive websites that users enjoy interacting with. I could spend all day in the depths of well-organized HTML, complex CSS, and my personal playground, JavaScript. With so many amazing animation tools and libraries out there, I could never learn all there is to know, but that won't stop me from trying. </p>

				<h1>Let's Talk About Me</h1>

				<h2>Who I Am</h2>

				<p>Passionate, focused, dedicated, and a voracious learner. Let's be honest, these adjectives sound like a cliche at this point, but without these qualities, I wouldn't be where I am today. I'm passionate about what I do, giving me the strength to pack up my life and move away from home in order to chase the career I wanted. Through the many challenges, I focused on what was important: becoming a great developer. Dedication allowed me to follow through and finish my formal education (of course, we know our education never truly ends), and endless learning is what keeps me in the game. </p>

				<h2>What I Love</h2>

				<p>Life is so full of interesting, exhilarating, and beautiful things to see and do. It's difficult to choose what we want to experience within one lifetime! I've been very lucky to have discovered so many of my passions in life already.</p>

				<p>Day-to-day, I love jamming out to all kinds of music, singing loudly in my car, and coming up with new concepts for video games. When I'm not designing, drawing, or coding, you can probably find me horseback riding. From dressage and show jumping to hunters and cross country, I love all things equestrian.</p>

				<h2>Why I'm Here</h2>

				<p>Born and raised in Michigan, I came to Omaha to start my career as a developer. After landing in a video game development start-up, I fell in love with this city and the people in it. I soon found my calling in web development, which allows me to combine my passion for art, design, and an appreciation for clean code. I love what I do, and I can't wait to make bigger, better apps for users all around the world.</p>
